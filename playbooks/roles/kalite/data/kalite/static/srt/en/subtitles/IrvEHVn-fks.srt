1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,580
   

2
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,170
How many ounces are
in 6 pounds?

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,670
So we have 6 pounds
and we need to

4
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:09,130
convert them to ounces.

5
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:12,110
And if you don't know it
already, you'll know it now,

6
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:15,530
that there are 16 ounces
per pound.

7
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:18,280
So what we want to do is we
want to have pounds in the

8
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,680
denominator.

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,250
It's in the numerator
right now.

10
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:29,980
So we want to divide by pounds
and multiply by ounces.

11
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,600
Maybe I'll write it out.

12
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,300
   

13
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,990
And I just told you
that there are 16

14
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:43,170
ounces for every 1 pound.

15
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,420
So if we multiplied these two
expressions, this pounds will

16
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,120
cancel with that pounds, and
we'll just be left with the

17
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,040
unit of ounces, which is what we
want, and we just multiply

18
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,410
6 times 16.

19
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:56,120
So it works out unit-wise, and
it makes sense as well.

20
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:00,880
If we have 16 ounces per pound,
and we have 6 pounds,

21
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,960
we just have to multiply
6 times 16.

22
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,840
That'll be the total number of
ounces we have. So this is

23
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,270
going to be equal to--
what's 6 times 16?

24
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:15,310
So if you take 16 times
6, 6 times 6 is 36.

25
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:16,100
Carry the 3.

26
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,400
6 times 1 is 6, plus 3 is 9.

27
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,550
So 6 times 16 is 96.

28
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,640
You have this divided by 1 here,
but that's not going to

29
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,650
change anything.

30
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:26,820
And then all we're
left with in the

31
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,700
dimensions are the ounces.

32
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,190
So 6 pounds are 96 ounces.

33
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:33,934
