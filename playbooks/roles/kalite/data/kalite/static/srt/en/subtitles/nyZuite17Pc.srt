1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,320
   

2
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,890
In this video, we're going to
learn how to take the distance

3
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:08,640
between any two points in our
x, y coordinate plane, and

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,060
we're going to see, it's really
just an application of

5
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,780
the Pythagorean theorem.

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,040
So let's start with
an example.

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,070
Let's say I have the point, I'll
do it in a darker color

8
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:17,950
so we can see it on
the graph paper.

9
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:22,070
Let's say I have the point
3 comma negative 4.

10
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:25,180
So if I were to graph it,
I'd go 1, 2, 3, and

11
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:26,480
then I'd go down 4.

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:33,440
1, 2, 3, 4, right there,
is 3 comma negative 4.

13
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:40,110
And let's say I also have
the point 6 comma 0.

14
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:45,660
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and then
there's no movement in the

15
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,310
y-direction.

16
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:47,610
We're just sitting
on the x-axis.

17
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:52,086
The y-coordinate is 0,
so that's 6 comma 0.

18
00:00:52,086 --> 00:00:55,810
And what I want to figure out is
the distance between these

19
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:56,410
two points.

20
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:00,350
How far is this blue point away
from this orange point?

21
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:01,910
And at first, you're like, gee,
Sal, I don't think I've

22
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:03,570
ever seen anything about
how to solve for a

23
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:04,440
distance like this.

24
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,290
And what are you even talking
about the Pythagorean theorem?

25
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:08,180
I don't see a triangle there!

26
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,690
And if you don't see
a triangle, let

27
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:10,940
me draw it for you.

28
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,770
   

29
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:18,060
Let me draw this triangle right
there, just like that.

30
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,690
Let me actually do several
colors here, just to really

31
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:23,090
hit the point home.

32
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:24,650
So there is our triangle.

33
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:25,990
And you might immediately
recognize

34
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:27,950
this is a right triangle.

35
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,810
This is a right angle
right there.

36
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:33,520
The base goes straight left to
right, the right side goes

37
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,710
straight up and down, so we're
dealing with a right triangle.

38
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:39,210
So if we could just figure out
what the base length is and

39
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,350
what this height is, we could
use the Pythagorean theorem to

40
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:47,690
figure out this long side, the
side that is opposite the

41
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,700
right angle, the hypotenuse.

42
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:55,890
This right here, the distance
is the hypotenuse of this

43
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,180
right triangle.

44
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,180
Let me write that down.

45
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:04,050
The distance is equal
to the hypotenuse

46
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:05,660
of this right triangle.

47
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,480
So let me draw it a
little bit bigger.

48
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,710
So this is the hypotenuse
right there.

49
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:14,880
And then we have the side on the
right, the side that goes

50
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,070
straight up and down.

51
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,500
And then we have our base.

52
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,860
Now, how do we figure
out-- let's

53
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,550
call this d for distance.

54
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,540
That's the length of
our hypotenuse.

55
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,640
How do we figure out the lengths
of this up and down

56
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,270
side and the base
side right here?

57
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,940
So let's look at the base first.
What is this distance?

58
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,010
You could even count it on this
graph paper, but here,

59
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:38,150
where x is equal to-- let
me do it in the green.

60
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:41,530
Here, we're at x is equal to 3
and here we're at x is equal

61
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:42,800
to 6, right?

62
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,550
We're just moving
straight right.

63
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,570
This is the same distance as
that distance right there.

64
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:49,910
So to figure out that distance,
it's literally the

65
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:50,710
end x point.

66
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,240
And you could actually go either
way, because you're

67
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,770
going to square everything, so
it doesn't matter if you get

68
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:59,230
negative numbers, so the
distance here is going to be 6

69
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:03,360
minus 3, right?

70
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,680
6 minus 3.

71
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,520
That's this distance right here,
which is equal to 3.

72
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,140
So we figured out the base.

73
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,610
And to just remind ourselves,
that is equal to

74
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,200
the change in x.

75
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,100
That was equal to your finishing
x minus your

76
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:17,890
starting x.

77
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:20,020
6 minus 3.

78
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,860
This is our delta x.

79
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:25,990
Now, by the same exact line of
reasoning, this height right

80
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:29,640
here is going to be
your change in y.

81
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,290
Up here, you're at
y is equal to 0.

82
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:32,670
That's kind of where
you finish.

83
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,360
That's your higher y point.

84
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,900
And over here, you're at y
is equal to negative 4.

85
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:42,460
So change in y is equal
to 0 minus negative 4.

86
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,930
I'm just taking the larger
y-value minus the smaller

87
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:48,810
y-value, the larger x-value
minus the smaller x-value.

88
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:49,870
But you're going to see we're
going to square it in a

89
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,830
second, so even if you did it
the other way around, you'd

90
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:53,410
get a negative number, but
you'd still get the same

91
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:56,030
answer, so this is equal to 4.

92
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,890
So this side is equal to 4.

93
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:00,370
You can even count it on the
graph paper if you like.

94
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,310
And this side is equal to 3.

95
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:07,040
And now we can do the
Pythagorean theorem.

96
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,730
This distance is the
distance squared.

97
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:12,400
Be careful.

98
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,270
The distance squared is going
to be equal to this delta x

99
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:19,649
squared, the change
in x squared plus

100
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:23,440
the change in y squared.

101
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,620
This is nothing fancy.

102
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,770
Sometimes people will call this
the distance formula.

103
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:29,380
It's just the Pythagorean
theorem.

104
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,660
This side squared plus that
side squared is equal to

105
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,940
hypotenuse squared, because
this is a right triangle.

106
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,260
So let's apply it with these
numbers, the numbers that we

107
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,410
have at hand.

108
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:43,020
So the distance squared is going
to be equal to delta x

109
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:47,580
squared is 3 squared plus
delta y squared plus 4

110
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:53,080
squared, which is equal to 9
plus 16, which is equal to 25.

111
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,050
So the distance is equal to--
let me write that-- d squared

112
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,550
is equal to 25.

113
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:01,600
d, our distance, is equal to--
you don't want to take the

114
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,160
negative square root, because
you can't have a negative

115
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,370
distance, So it's only the
principal root, the positive

116
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:09,020
square root of 25, which
is equal to 5.

117
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,780
So this distance right
here is 5.

118
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,130
Or if we look at this distance
right here, that was the

119
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:13,920
original problem.

120
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,170
How far is this point
from that point?

121
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:20,180
It is 5 units away.

122
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,930
So what you'll see here, they
call it the distance formula,

123
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,730
but it's just the Pythagorean
theorem.

124
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:27,000
And just so you're exposed to
all of the ways that you'll

125
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,770
see the distance formula,
sometimes people will say, oh,

126
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:33,340
if I have two points, if I have
one point, let's call it

127
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:37,580
x1 and y1, so that's just
a particular point.

128
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:42,880
And let's say I have another
point that is x2 comma y2.

129
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,760
Sometimes, you'll see this
formula, that the distance--

130
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,940
you'll see it in
different ways.

131
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:49,850
But you'll see that the distance
is equal to-- and it

132
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,170
looks as though there's this
really complicated formula,

133
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,930
but I want you to see that
this is really just the

134
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,370
Pythagorean theorem.

135
00:05:55,370 --> 00:06:05,340
You see that the distance is
equal to x2 minus x1 minus x1

136
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:18,650
squared plus y2 minus
y1 squared.

137
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:20,950
You'll see this written in
a lot of textbooks as the

138
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,200
distance formula.

139
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,855
   

140
00:06:24,855 --> 00:06:27,250
And it's a complete waste of
your time to memorize it

141
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:30,060
because it's really just the
Pythagorean theorem.

142
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,370
This is your change in x.

143
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,710
And it really doesn't matter
which x you pick to be first

144
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,730
or second, because even if you
get the negative of this

145
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,470
value, when you square it,
the negative disappears.

146
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:42,900
This right here is
your change in y.

147
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,693
So it's just saying that the
distance squared-- remember,

148
00:06:44,693 --> 00:06:48,710
if you square both sides of
this equation, the radical

149
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:51,010
will disappear and this will
be the distance squared is

150
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:54,900
equal to this expression
squared, delta x squared,

151
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:59,090
change in x-- delta means change
in-- delta x squared

152
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:01,540
plus delta y squared.

153
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,190
I don't want to confuse you.

154
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:04,170
Delta y just means
change in y.

155
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:06,380
I should have probably said
that earlier in the video.

156
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,290
But let's apply it to a couple
more, and I'll just pick some

157
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:10,030
points at random.

158
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:14,850
Let's say I have the point,
let's see, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

159
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:17,660
Negative 6 comma negative 4.

160
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:22,370
   

161
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,430
And let's say I want to find the
distance between that and

162
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:32,290
1 comma 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and
the point 1 comma 7, so I

163
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:34,370
want to find this distance
right here.

164
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,420
So it's the exact same idea.

165
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,610
We just use the Pythagorean
theorem.

166
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:41,830
You figure out this distance,
which is our change in x, this

167
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,790
distance, which is
our change in y.

168
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,955
This distance squared plus this
distance squared is going

169
00:07:45,955 --> 00:07:48,750
to equal that distance
squared.

170
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,600
So let's do it.

171
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,160
So our change in x, you
just take-- you

172
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,130
know, it doesn't matter.

173
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:56,170
In general, you want to take the
larger x-value minus the

174
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:58,400
smaller x-value, but you
could do it either way.

175
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,180
So we could write the distance
squared is equal to-- what's

176
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,430
our change in x?

177
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:08,650
So let's take the larger x minus
the smaller x, 1 minus

178
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:09,430
negative 6.

179
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:14,960
1 minus negative 6 squared
plus the change in y.

180
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,120
The larger y is here.

181
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,530
It's 7.

182
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,210
7 minus negative 4.

183
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:22,550
7 minus negative 4 squared.

184
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,430
And I just picked these numbers
at random, so they're

185
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:26,260
probably not going to come
out too cleanly.

186
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:30,490
So we get that the distance
squared is equal to 1 minus

187
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:31,280
negative 6.

188
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,000
That is 7, 7 squared, and you'll
even see it over here,

189
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,169
if you count it.

190
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:39,690
You go, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

191
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,470
That's that number right here.

192
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,400
That's what your
change in x is.

193
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,530
Plus 7 minus negative 4.

194
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:47,720
That's 11.

195
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,010
That's this distance right here,
and you can count it on

196
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:51,490
the blocks.

197
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,650
We're going up 11.

198
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:55,860
We're just taking 7 minus
negative 4 to get

199
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,740
a distance of 11.

200
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:01,750
So plus 11 squared is
equal to d squared.

201
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:05,000
So let me just take the
calculator out.

202
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:13,266
So the distance if we take 7
squared plus 11 squared is

203
00:09:13,266 --> 00:09:16,170
equal to 170, that distance is
going to be the square root of

204
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:18,920
that, right? d squared
is equal to 170.

205
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:25,250
So let's take the square root
of 170 and we get 13.0,

206
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,250
roughly 13.04.

207
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,550
So this distance right
here that we tried to

208
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:35,920
figure out is 13.04.

209
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,540
Hopefully, you found
that helpful.
