1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,650
   

2
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:02,510
We're on problem 36.

3
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:06,560
And it says, what is the area
in square units of the

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,180
trapezoid shown below?

5
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,930
So, when you just look at this
you're like, OK, trapezoid, do

6
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:14,580
I know the formula for the
area of a trapezoid.

7
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,990
Then you might get confused
and all that.

8
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,520
But you say, well, trapezoid
I can break that up into a

9
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,120
rectangle and a triangle.

10
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,935
If were to draw a
line right here.

11
00:00:22,935 --> 00:00:26,110
   

12
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,220
Then I've broken up the
trapezoid into a rectangle and

13
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:29,030
a triangle.

14
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:32,720
And if I know the dimensions of
each of those, I know the

15
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,480
area of each of them and
then I know the area

16
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,980
of the entire thing.

17
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:39,790
So let's see, what's this height
right Here Or this

18
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:43,000
width I should say.

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,430
Well we're going from
zero to what?

20
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:48,480
x is equal to 8 here.

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,390
I just went straight down
from x is equal to 8,

22
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:51,260
y is equal to 5.

23
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,720
So this dimension is 8.

24
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,190
And then we go from x is equal
to 8 to x is equal to 12, how

25
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,210
far is that?

26
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,060
Well, that's going to be 4.

27
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,840
So this is 4 and this is 8.

28
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,080
Fair enough.

29
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,000
And then how high is
this rectangle?

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,380
We're going from y is equal
to zero to y is equal to

31
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,030
5, so that's 5.

32
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:12,035
And of course this
is 5 as well.

33
00:01:12,035 --> 00:01:13,450
So we're done.

34
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:14,620
We're ready to figure
out the area.

35
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:18,730
The area of the rectangle part
is 8 times 5, that's 40.

36
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:23,030
The area of this triangle
is 5 times 4 times 1/2.

37
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,690
If we didn't put that 1/2 we
would be figuring out the area

38
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:26,310
of this rectangle right there.

39
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,710
So 5 times 4 is 20
times 1/2 is 10.

40
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:36,050
So the area of both of these
combined is 10 plus 40 is 50.

41
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:37,770
37.

42
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,380
The figure below is a square
with 4 congruent

43
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,615
parallelograms in side.

44
00:01:41,615 --> 00:01:43,030
This looks interesting.

45
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:46,180
What is the area in square units
of the shaded portion?

46
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:50,240
So the shaded portion is the
whole square minus the area of

47
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:50,960
the parallelogram.

48
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,780
So the whole square, that's
easy, it's 12.

49
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,540
And the height is 12, but since
you know it's a square

50
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,830
we know the width also
has to be 12.

51
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:04,670
So the area of the whole
square is 144.

52
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,700
If we know the area of one of
the parallelograms, we know

53
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,930
the area of all of the
parallelograms because they

54
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,419
are congruent.

55
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:12,140
So let's see if we can figure
out the area of one of the

56
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,870
parallelograms.

57
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,840
So there is actually a formula
for the area of a

58
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,200
parallelogram, it's
actually just the

59
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,360
base times the height.

60
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,420
And they actually
give us that.

61
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,600
But let me show you that they
give us that because it might

62
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,090
not be obvious to you.

63
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:28,510
Let me try to draw it.

64
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:31,370
I'll use my line tool.

65
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:32,900
Nope, that's not
the line tool.

66
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,260
   

67
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:41,430
One side, then go straight
like that, come down like

68
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:45,590
that, good enough.

69
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:49,000
OK, now if I look at just this
parallelgoram, they tell us

70
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,320
that the height here is 3.

71
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,280
   

72
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,650
And I know it's the height
because they told me it's a 90

73
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:55,400
degree angle.

74
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,930
And they tell us at
the base is 5.

75
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,250
And I'm telling you that the
area of a parallelogram is

76
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,340
just the base times the
height is equal to 15.

77
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,010
But you shouldn't just
take my word for it.

78
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:08,000
That should make intuitive
sense to you.

79
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,970
And the way to think about it
intuitively is imagine if we

80
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:17,970
were to take this part of the
parallelogram, and if we were

81
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:19,750
to move it over here.

82
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,710
If we were to cut that off
and move it over here.

83
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:25,460
Then the parallelogram would
look something like this.

84
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:29,250
You'd have the part that
we didn't cut off.

85
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,250
And then you move the cut-off
part over here.

86
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,940
   

87
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,230
And now the dimensions, this
base would be 5, and this

88
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,110
height would be 3.

89
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:41,040
And the area of this
rectangle is 15.

90
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,850
And there's no reason why the
area of this should be any

91
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:43,460
different than that.

92
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,240
We just rearranged its parts.

93
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,130
So that's why the area of a
parallelogram is just the base

94
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:49,160
times the height.

95
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,700
So the area of each of these
parallelograms is 15.

96
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,050
So the area of all of
them combined is 15

97
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,960
times 4, which is 60.

98
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:03,655
So 144 minus 60 is 84.

99
00:04:03,655 --> 00:04:08,250
And that's choice B.

100
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,680
Problem 38.

101
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,690
What is the area in square
meters of the

102
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:14,000
trapezoid shown below.

103
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,510
So to figure out the area and
we could break it up into

104
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,970
these rectangles
and triangles.

105
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,700
To figure out the area
of this rectangle we

106
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,300
need to know its height.

107
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,170
And actually we'll need that to
figure out the area of the

108
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,670
triangles as well.

109
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:30,250
So what's this height
right there?

110
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:34,030
Let's see, we know that this
distance is going to be 6.

111
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,280
It's a rectangle.

112
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,430
   

113
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:41,550
If that distance is 6 and both
of these are 5, both of these

114
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:44,920
triangles here are going
to be congruent.

115
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,090
Because this length is
equal to this length.

116
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:51,600
This length is equal
to this length.

117
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,590
And we also we make this angle
is equal to that angle.

118
00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:01,200
But anyway, let me do
it in another color.

119
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,370
What's the length of these
two green sides?

120
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:07,180
Let's call it x.

121
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,460
Well we know that when you
add x plus 6 plus x it

122
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,440
has to equal 12.

123
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,070
The whole top part.

124
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:16,850
So you get x plus x is 2x
plus 6 is equal to 12.

125
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,410
2x is equal to 6.

126
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:19,840
x is equal to 3.

127
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,410
And you might have been able
to solve that in your head.

128
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,990
That if that's 6 and these are
the same, then both of these

129
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,630
are going to be 3.

130
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,870
And now we can use that
information to figure out this

131
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,170
height right there.

132
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:36,230
Because if we just draw this
triangle right there, that's

133
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:40,970
3, that's 5, this is some
unknown side, a.

134
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,690
You might already recognize,
we're going to use the

135
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:43,390
Pythagorean theorem.

136
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:46,490
And this is a very typical
type of right triangle.

137
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:48,390
So might already be able
to guess what a is.

138
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,680
But we'll solve for it.

139
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,150
So we know that a squared plus
3 squared is equal to the

140
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:57,510
hypotenuse squared, the side
opposite the 90 degree angle.

141
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:00,230
So that's equal to 25.

142
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,230
5 squared is 25.

143
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:06,020
a squared plus 9
is equal to 25.

144
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,190
a squared is equal to 16.

145
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:10,420
a is equal to 4.

146
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,580
a is equal to 4.

147
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,260
And now we're ready to
figure out the area.

148
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,920
What's the area of
the rectangle?

149
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,140
6 times 6, it's 24.

150
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,590
What's the area of each
of these triangles?

151
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:23,730
3 times 4 times 1/2.

152
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:27,020
3 times 4 is 12 times
1/2 is 6.

153
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,620
So the area of that
triangle is 6.

154
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,310
The area of this
triangle is 6.

155
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:35,050
So 6 plus 24 plus 6 is 36.

156
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,930
B.

157
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:40,010
Problem 39.

158
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:44,660
What is the area in square
inches of the triangle below.

159
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,800
Interesting.

160
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,710
OK, so this is an equilateral
triangle, all

161
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:50,070
the sides are equal.

162
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:53,270
And so we could actually say
that since these two triangles

163
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,790
are symmetric.

164
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,160
That's equal to that.

165
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,820
And this comes to a general
formula for the area of an

166
00:06:58,820 --> 00:06:59,330
equilateral triangle.

167
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:00,770
But let's just figure
it all out.

168
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:03,740
So this side is going to be 5.

169
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,390
And this side is
going to be 5.

170
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:09,810
If this is 5 and that's 10, what
is this side right here?

171
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:11,520
Let's call it x.

172
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,600
Pythagorean theorem.

173
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,520
This is the hypotenuse.

174
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:20,080
So x squared plus 5 squared plus
25 is going to be equal

175
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,440
to the hypotenuse squared,
it's equal to 100.

176
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,460
x squared is equal to
100 minus 25, 75.

177
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:30,860
x is equal to the square
root of 75.

178
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,900
75 is 25 times 3.

179
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,710
So that's equal to the square
root of 25 times 3.

180
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:39,390
Which is equal to the square
root of 25 times the

181
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,830
square root of 3.

182
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:44,250
Which is equal to
5 roots of 3.

183
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:48,960
   

184
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,410
And now, what's the area
of just this right

185
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:52,380
triangle right here?

186
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,080
This one on the right side.

187
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,000
Well its base is 5, its height
is 5 roots of 3.

188
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,310
So it's going to be 1/2 times
the base, 5, times the height,

189
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:06,080
5 roots of 3.

190
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,360
And that's what?

191
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,730
1/2 times 5 times 5.

192
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:14,380
So it's 25 root 3 over 2 and
that's just this triangle

193
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,460
right there.

194
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:19,720
Well this triangle's going to
have the the exact same area.

195
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,540
They are congruent triangles.

196
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:25,530
So the area of the figure
is this times 2.

197
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:29,410
So 2 times that is equal
to just the 25 root 3.

198
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:33,000
And that's choice B.

199
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,700
Next problem, problem 40.

200
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,600
The perimeter of two squares
are in a ratio of 4:9.

201
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,250
What is the ratio between the
areas of the two squares?

202
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:45,630
Let me draw two squares.

203
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,300
That's one square.

204
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,090
Let me draw another square.

205
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:51,610
That's another square.

206
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:58,210
Let's say that the sides of this
are x and the sides of

207
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:59,460
this one are y.

208
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,900
   

209
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,460
So they say the perimeters of
those two squares are in a

210
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,460
ratio of 4:9.

211
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,890
So the perimeter of the
first square is 4x.

212
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:10,190
x plus x plus x plus x.

213
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:12,770
So the perimeter of the
first square is 4x.

214
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:16,540
The perimeter of the second
square is 4y.

215
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,880
So that's the ratio of the
perimeter of the first square

216
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,400
to the perimeter of
the second square.

217
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,600
And then that is equal to 4:9.

218
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,420
   

219
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,800
And they say, what is the ratio
between the areas of the

220
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,450
two squares?

221
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:33,685
So they want us to figure out
the area of the first square

222
00:09:33,685 --> 00:09:36,700
is x squared.

223
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,630
Base times height, x times x.

224
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:42,580
And the are of the second
square is y times y.

225
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:47,700
So they want us to figure out
what that is equal to.

226
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,140
Well this is x squared
over y squared.

227
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:55,690
This is the same thing
as x over y squared.

228
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:58,150
So if we can figure out what x
over y is equal to, we can

229
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,430
just square it and we'll get
x squared over y squared.

230
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:02,290
So let's try to do that.

231
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:03,540
So they gave us this.

232
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,130
   

233
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:09,235
Well this just simplifies.

234
00:10:09,235 --> 00:10:11,213
x over y is equal to 4 over 9.

235
00:10:11,213 --> 00:10:14,780
   

236
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,210
So let's substitute that here.

237
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:20,360
So x squared over y squared is
equal to x over y squared.

238
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,910
Which is equal to 4/9 squared.

239
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:28,430
Which is equal to 16 over 81.

240
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:32,680
Or the ratio of the areas of
the two squares is 16:81.

241
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,830
Choice D.

242
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:39,060
I think we can fit one more
problem in there.

243
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,330
Actually no, I'm over
10 minutes.

244
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:41,510
I'll stop right there.

245
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,360
See you in the next video.

246
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:43,400
