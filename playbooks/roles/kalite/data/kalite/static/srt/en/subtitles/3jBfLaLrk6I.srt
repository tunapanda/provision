1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,600
   

2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,990
Round 1,585 to the
nearest ten.

3
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:06,290
Let me rewrite the number.

4
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:11,500
1,585 to the nearest ten.

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,860
So we want to focus
on the tens place.

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,610
   

7
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:24,240
If we were to round it up, we
would go to 1,500-- let me

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:24,950
color code it.

9
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:29,162
We would round up to 1,590.

10
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:31,590
The 8 would round up to a 9.

11
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:38,425
And 90, if we were to round
down, we would go to 1,500,

12
00:00:38,425 --> 00:00:41,190
and we would round down to 80.

13
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,560
So these are our two choices.

14
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,370
Now we've seen the last
two examples.

15
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:47,590
If the place to the right
of it is 5 or

16
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,790
greater, we round up.

17
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,340
Well, the place to the
right of it is

18
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,010
definitely 5 or greater.

19
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:56,130
It is 5, so we round up.

20
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:00,890
So it is 1,590.

21
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:02,420
And we're done!

22
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:03,334
