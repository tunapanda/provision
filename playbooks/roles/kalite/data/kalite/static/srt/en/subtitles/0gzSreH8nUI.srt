1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,371
I thought I would do some more example problems involving triangles. And so in this first one it says the

2
00:00:05,371 --> 00:00:13,233
measure of the largest angle in a triangle is four times the measure of the second largest angle. The

3
00:00:13,233 --> 00:00:20,283
smallest angle is ten degrees. What are the measures of all the angles? Well we know one of them, we

4
00:00:20,283 --> 00:00:22,173
know it's ten degrees.

5
00:00:22,173 --> 00:00:25,503
Let's draw an arbitrary triangle right over here. now let's say that is our triangle.

6
00:00:25,503 --> 00:00:30,260
We know the the smallest angle is going to be ten degrees and I'll just say let's just assume that this

7
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:36,382
right over here is the measure of the smallest angle. It's ten degrees. Now let's call the second largest

8
00:00:36,382 --> 00:00:46,349
angle, let's call that x. So this is going to be x. And then the first sentence, they say the measure

9
00:00:46,349 --> 00:00:51,409
of the largest angle in the triangle is four times, four times the measure of the second largest angle.

10
00:00:51,409 --> 00:00:59,041
So if the second largest angle is x, four times that measure is going to be 4x. So the largest angle

11
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:05,872
is going to be 4x. And so, the one thing we know about the measures of the angles inside a triangle is

12
00:01:05,872 --> 00:01:20,637
they add up to 180 degrees. So we know that 4x + x + 10 degrees is going to be equal to 180 degrees.

13
00:01:20,637 --> 00:01:30,993
And 4x + x, that just gives us 5x. And then we have 5x + 10 is equal to 180 degrees. Subtract 10 from

14
00:01:30,993 --> 00:01:44,540
both sides, you get 5x = 170. And so, x = 170 / 5. Let's see, it will go into it 34 times? Let me verify

15
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:50,502
this. So 5 goes into, yeah, it should be 34 times. It's going to go into it twice as many times as 10

16
00:01:50,502 --> 00:01:56,100
would go into it. 10 would go into 170 17 times, 5 would go into 170 34 times.

17
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:05,097
So we can verify it. 3 times 5 is 15. Subtract, we get 2. Bring down the 0.

18
00:02:05,097 --> 00:02:09,822
5 goes into 20 four times. And then you can have the remainder. 4 times 5 is 20.

19
00:02:09,822 --> 00:02:13,918
No remainder. So it's 34 times. X is equal to 34.

20
00:02:13,918 --> 00:02:21,696
So the second largest angle has the measure of 34 degrees. This angle up here is going to be 4 times that.

21
00:02:21,696 --> 00:02:28,034
So 4 times 34, it's gonna be 120 degrees plus 16 degrees. This is going to be...

22
00:02:28,034 --> 00:02:34,812
136 degrees. Is that right? 4 times 4 is 16. 4 times 30 is 120.

23
00:02:34,812 --> 00:02:37,861
16 plus 120 is 136 degrees. So we're done.

24
00:02:37,861 --> 00:02:45,862
The three measures or the sizes of the three angles are 10 degrees, 34 degrees and 136 degrees.

25
00:02:45,862 --> 00:02:47,625
Let's do another one.

26
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:50,743
So let's see. We have a little bit of a drawing here.

27
00:02:50,743 --> 00:02:54,110
And what I want to do is, and we could think about different things.

28
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:59,310
We could say, let's solve for x. I'm assuming that 4x is the measure of this angle.

29
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,374
2x is the measure of that angle right over there.

30
00:03:02,374 --> 00:03:08,505
We can solve for x and if we know x we can figure out what the actual measures of these angles are. Assuming that we can figure out x.

31
00:03:08,505 --> 00:03:13,759
And the other thing that they tell us is that this line over here is parallel to this line over here.

32
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:19,016
And it's craftily drawn because it's parallel but one stops here and one sparks up there.

33
00:03:19,016 --> 00:03:22,616
So the first thing I want to do, if they're telling us these two lines are parallel,

34
00:03:22,616 --> 00:03:25,851
it's probably going to be something involving transversals or something.

35
00:03:25,851 --> 00:03:29,018
It might be something involving, the other option is something involving triangles.

36
00:03:29,018 --> 00:03:32,966
And at first you might say, wait, is this angle and that angle vertical angle?

37
00:03:32,966 --> 00:03:35,939
But we have to be very careful. They are not. These are not the same lines.

38
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:42,519
This line is parallel to that line. This line it's bending right over there.

39
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:44,262
So we can't make any attempt of assumption like that.

40
00:03:44,262 --> 00:03:48,796
So the interesting thing, and I'm not sure if this will lead us in the right direction,

41
00:03:48,796 --> 00:03:52,600
is to just make it clear that these two are part of parallel lines.

42
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:57,739
So I could continue this line down like this. And I can continue this line up like that.

43
00:03:57,739 --> 00:04:02,130
And then that starts to look a little bit more like we're used to when we're dealing with parallel lines.

44
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:07,562
And then this line segment BC or we could even say line BC if we were to continue it on,

45
00:04:07,562 --> 00:04:11,840
if we were to continue it on and on even pass D.

46
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,901
Then this is clearly a transversal of those two parallel lines. This is clearly a trasnversal.

47
00:04:16,901 --> 00:04:22,470
And so if this angle right over here, if this angle right over here is 4x,

48
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:27,838
it has a corresponding angle. Half of the..or maybe most of the work on all these

49
00:04:27,838 --> 00:04:34,792
is to try to see the parallel lines and see the transversal and see the things that might be useful for you.

50
00:04:34,792 --> 00:04:36,746
So that right there is the transversal.

51
00:04:36,746 --> 00:04:41,444
These are the parallel lines, that's one parallel line, that's the other parallel line.

52
00:04:41,444 --> 00:04:43,934
You can almost try to zone out all the other stuff in the diagram.

53
00:04:43,934 --> 00:04:52,294
And so if this angle right over here is 4x, it has a corresponding angle where the transversal intersects the other parallel line.

54
00:04:52,294 --> 00:04:55,819
This right here is its corresponding angle.

55
00:04:55,819 --> 00:04:58,301
So let me draw it in the same yellow.

56
00:04:58,301 --> 00:05:00,446
So this right here is the corresponding angle.

57
00:05:00,446 --> 00:05:04,323
So this will also be, this will also be 4x.

58
00:05:04,323 --> 00:05:09,861
And we see that this angle and this angle, this angle has a measure of 4x,

59
00:05:09,861 --> 00:05:13,791
this angle has a measure of 2x. We can see that they're supplementary.

60
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:18,609
They're adjacent to each other. The outer sides form a straight angle.

61
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:21,758
So they're supplementary which means that their measure add up to 180 degrees.

62
00:05:21,758 --> 00:05:26,905
They go all the way around like that, if you add the two adjacent angles together.

63
00:05:26,905 --> 00:05:33,147
So we know that 4x plus 2x needs to be equal to 180 degrees.

64
00:05:33,147 --> 00:05:36,422
Or we get 6x is equal to 180 degrees.

65
00:05:36,422 --> 00:05:40,629
Divide both sides by 6, you get x is equal to 30.

66
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:48,957
And this angle right over here is 2 times x, so it's going to be 60 degrees.

67
00:05:48,957 --> 00:05:52,914
So this angle right over here is going to be 60 degrees.

68
00:05:52,914 --> 00:06:02,811
And this angle right over here is 4 times x. So it is 120 degrees.

69
00:06:02,811 --> 00:06:05,000
And we're done.
