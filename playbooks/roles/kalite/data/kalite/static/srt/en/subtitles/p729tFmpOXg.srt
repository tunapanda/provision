1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,740
   

2
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:03,310
Multiply 6 times 1/4.

3
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:07,160
Simplify your answer and write
it as a mixed number.

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,170
So let's just do the
multiplication.

5
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:12,470
So at first when you try to
multiply 6 times 1/4, you'll

6
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,340
be like, well, gee, I know
how to multiply a

7
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,720
fraction times a fraction.

8
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,110
I know how to multiply a whole
number times a whole number,

9
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:20,580
but what about a whole number
times a fraction?

10
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,110
And kind of the key insight
you need here is that any

11
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:25,430
whole number can be written
as a fraction.

12
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:31,720
We can rewrite 6
as 6/1, right?

13
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,020
6 divided by 1 is 6.

14
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,220
6 ones is 6.

15
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:38,360
Depending how you think about
it, this is exactly the same

16
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,720
thing as 6.

17
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,210
So we just rewrote our whole
number as a fraction.

18
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,320
You can do it for any number.

19
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,610
10 is the same thing as 10/1.

20
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:54,930
So this become 6/1 times
1/4, and then we just

21
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,160
multiply the fraction.

22
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,740
We multiply the numerators, so
this is equal to 6 times 1 as

23
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:01,590
our numerator.

24
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,519
Let me do that in
another color.

25
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:08,270
So this becomes 6 times 1 for
our numerator and 1 times 4

26
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:11,190
for our denominator, for the
number on the bottom.

27
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:14,260
And so this will become
6 over 4.

28
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,000
And right now, it's just as an
improper fraction and it's

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,900
also not in lowest terms. You
immediately see 6 and 4 are

30
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:23,190
both divisible by 2, so let's
divide them both by 2.

31
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:25,334
If you divide 6 by 2--
and I'll do it

32
00:01:25,334 --> 00:01:26,370
in a new color again.

33
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:29,515
If you divide 6 by
2, you get 3.

34
00:01:29,515 --> 00:01:35,290
If you divide 4 by 2, you get
2, so this is equal to 3/2.

35
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,300
So it's still written as
an improper fraction.

36
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,570
We now have to write it
as a mixed a number.

37
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,350
And the process for writing it
as a mixed number, you just

38
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:45,820
divide the denominator into the
numerator, so this just

39
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:50,920
becomes 2 into 3.

40
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,820
Divide 2 into 3.

41
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,560
2 goes into 3 one time.

42
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,880
1 times 2 is 2.

43
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,930
You subtract.

44
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,680
You have a remainder of 1.

45
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:10,474
So this will become one whole
and 1/2 left over.

46
00:02:10,474 --> 00:02:14,760
   

47
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,610
So this is 1 and 1/2.

48
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:17,900
So that's our right answer.

49
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,040
We've just simplified the answer
and wrote it is a mixed

50
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,810
number or we could simplify
it at this stage.

51
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,830
We could say right here, well,
look, we could divide what's

52
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:29,310
eventually going to be in the
numerator by 2 and get a 3

53
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,660
there, and divide what's
eventually in the denominator

54
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,990
by 2 and get a 2 there.

55
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:36,370
3 times 1 is 3.

56
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:38,985
1 times 2 is 2, so it's 3/2.

57
00:02:38,985 --> 00:02:40,830
And you do this exact
same process.

58
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:44,040
You say that 3/2 is the same
thing as 1 and 1/2.

59
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,120
Either one of those will work.

60
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,910
Now let's think about why
this makes sense.

61
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:52,500
Let's think about what
6 times 1/4 is.

62
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,410
Let me draw 1/4.

63
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:57,130
Let's say that that is
1/4 right there, and

64
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,120
let's do six of them.

65
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:04,450
So that's 1/4, that's 2/4 that's
3/4, that's 4/4, which

66
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:08,150
would be a whole, and then
you have 5/4, and

67
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,320
then you have 6/4.

68
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,710
So this is 6 times 1/4.

69
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:13,580
   

70
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,590
This right here is 4/4.

71
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:21,090
This right here is 4 over 4,
which is equal to a 1, so this

72
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:22,600
is equal to 1.

73
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,580
And then this right here
is two 1/4's, or this

74
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,710
right here is 2/4.

75
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:31,600
You can imagine this is two out
of a potential, if a whole

76
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,300
has to have two more of them,
has to have four of them. so

77
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:42,860
this is 1 and-- let me do it
in the same colors-- 1 and

78
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,270
1/2, right?

79
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:49,720
2 out of 4 is the same thing as
1/2, so this right here is

80
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:55,930
one out of a possible
one, and then two.

81
00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:02,990
So this is 1 and 1/2, which is
exactly what we got before.

82
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:02,999
