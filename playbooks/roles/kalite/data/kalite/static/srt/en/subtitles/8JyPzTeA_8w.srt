1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,750
   

2
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,290
Write 7/4 as a mixed number.

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:06,210
So right now it's an
improper fraction.

4
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:07,580
7 is larger than 4.

5
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:09,160
Let's write it is
a mixed number.

6
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,110
So first I'm just going
to show you a fairly

7
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:12,510
straightforward way of doing
it and then we're going to

8
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,830
think a little bit about
what it actually means.

9
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:20,210
So to figure out what 7/4
represents as a mixed number,

10
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:22,560
let me write it in
different colors.

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,045
So this is going to be equal
to-- the easiest way I do it

12
00:00:26,045 --> 00:00:29,540
is you say, well, you
divide 4 it 7.

13
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:36,280
   

14
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,910
If we're dealing with fourths,
4 goes into 7 a

15
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:40,240
total of one time.

16
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,370
   

17
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:44,620
Let me do this in
another color.

18
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,100
   

19
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,220
1 times 4 is 4.

20
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,600
And then what is
our remainder?

21
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,160
7 minus 4 is 3.

22
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,680
So if we wanted to write this
in plain-- well, let me just

23
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,150
do the problem, and then
we'll think about what

24
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,460
it means in a second.

25
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:05,019
So you see that 4 goes into 7
one time, so you have one

26
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:10,200
whole here, and then how much
do you have left over?

27
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,810
Well, you have 3 left
over, and that comes

28
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:16,700
from right over there.

29
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,630
That is the remainder when
you divide 4 into 7.

30
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:26,000
3 left over, but it's 3 of
your 4, or 3/4 left over.

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,880
So that's the way we just
converted it from an improper

32
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,200
fraction to a mixed number.

33
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,650
Now, it might seem
a little bit like

34
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,190
voodoo what I just did.

35
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:36,780
I divided 4 into 7, it goes
one time, and then the

36
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,530
remainder is 3, so
I got 1 and 3/4.

37
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,480
But why does that make sense?

38
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,480
Why does that actually
makes sense?

39
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,230
So let's draw fourths.

40
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:53,540
Let's draw literally 7 fourths
and maybe it'll become clear.

41
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:56,460
So let's do a little
square as a fourth.

42
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:03,750
So let's say I have a square
like that, and that is 1/4.

43
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,170
Now, let's think about what
seven of those mean, so let me

44
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,410
copy and paste that.

45
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:11,500
Copy and then paste it.

46
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:17,510
So here I have 2 one-fourths,
or you could see I have 2/4.

47
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:20,740
Now I have 3 one-fourths.

48
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,950
Now, I have 4 one-fourths.

49
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,430
Now this is a whole, right?

50
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,800
I have 4 one-fourths.

51
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,310
This is a whole.

52
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,910
So let me start on
another whole.

53
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,500
So now I have 5.

54
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:37,890
Now I have 6 one-fourths, and
now I have 7 one-fourths.

55
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,410
Now, what does this look like?

56
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:43,490
So all I did is I rewrote
7/4, or 7 one-fourths.

57
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:45,630
I just kind of drew
it for you.

58
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,350
Now, what does this represent?

59
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:52,110
Well, I have 4 fourths
here, so this is 4/4.

60
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:55,750
This right here is 3/4.

61
00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:01,980
Notice, 7/4 is 4/4 with
3/4 left over.

62
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,110
So let me write it this way.

63
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:09,330
7/4 is 4/4 with 3/4 left over.

64
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,580
Now what is 4/4?

65
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,350
   

66
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:16,320
4/4 is one whole.

67
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,970
So you have one whole with
3/4 left over, so you end

68
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:23,400
up with 1 and 3/4.

69
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,470
So that is the 3/4 part and
that is your one whole.

70
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,590
Hopefully that makes sense and
hopefully you understand why

71
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,440
it connects.

72
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,760
Because you say, well, how
many wholes do you have?

73
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,100
When you're dividing the 4 into
the 7 and getting the

74
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,550
one, you're essentially saying
how many wholes?

75
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:42,250
   

76
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:47,070
So the number of wholes, or you
can imagine, the number of

77
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,190
whole pies.

78
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:50,680
And then how many pieces
do we have left over?

79
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,770
Well, we have 3 pieces and each
piece is 1/4, so we have

80
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,430
3/4 left over.

81
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:59,080
So we have one whole pie and
three pieces, which are each a

82
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,200
fourth left over.
