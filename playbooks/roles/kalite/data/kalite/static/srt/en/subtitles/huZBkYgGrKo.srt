1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,133
Suppose marketing experts have determined the relationship between the selling price of an item

2
00:00:06,133 --> 00:00:14,452
and the cost of an item can be represented by the linear equation q = -30s + 800,

3
00:00:14,452 --> 00:00:19,092
where q is the quantity sold in a year and s is the selling price.

4
00:00:19,092 --> 00:00:23,748
If the cost to produce the item is $20,

5
00:00:23,748 --> 00:00:27,513
so the cost to produce an item is $20,

6
00:00:27,513 --> 00:00:33,154
what is the selling price that optimizes the yearly, the yearly, profit?

7
00:00:33,154 --> 00:00:36,333
So what's the profit going to be? So let me write this down.

8
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:42,852
So a yearly profit is going to be the quantity, is going to be, the quantity that we sell in a year,

9
00:00:42,852 --> 00:00:45,815
it's going to be the quantity that we sell in a year,

10
00:00:45,815 --> 00:00:53,348
times, times, the price that we sell it at, price, times the price that we sell it at,

11
00:00:53,348 --> 00:01:00,252
minus the cost of us actually producing that item, and in this case they tell us it is $20.

12
00:01:00,252 --> 00:01:05,871
So for example, if we sell two items, if q is 2 and we sell them for $25,

13
00:01:05,871 --> 00:01:11,067
we're gonna make $5 on each item, 'cause it cost each of them cost us 5, $20 to produce,

14
00:01:11,067 --> 00:01:13,744
so 25 minus 20 will be 5.

15
00:01:13,744 --> 00:01:20,098
If we sell two items at that price it'll be 2 times 5 or we'll have a profit of $10.

16
00:01:20,098 --> 00:01:23,475
So what, how can we figure out how to maximize this profit?

17
00:01:23,475 --> 00:01:27,559
Well they gave us the quantity as a function of selling price,

18
00:01:27,559 --> 00:01:31,675
so we could, we could express the entire profit as a function of selling price.

19
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:42,744
So we could say, we can substitute q is equal to -30 s plus 800 right over, right over here.

20
00:01:42,744 --> 00:01:44,644
And let's be very clear what this is telling us.

21
00:01:44,644 --> 00:01:50,718
This is telling us that if the selling price increases, then this will become a larger negative number

22
00:01:50,718 --> 00:01:55,071
so we're going to sell fewer, we're gonna sell a smaller quantity.

23
00:01:55,071 --> 00:01:58,400
And actually if you believe this, and if you actually made the selling price zero,

24
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:04,118
if you just gave away this product, it tells us that we would sell at most 800.

25
00:02:04,148 --> 00:02:07,062
So it might not be a perfect model but let's just use this for,

26
00:02:07,062 --> 00:02:10,548
you know some marketing experts have told us this, so let's just use it.

27
00:02:10,548 --> 00:02:21,938
So if we substitute -30 s plus 800 for q, we get -30 s plus 800 times s minus 20,

28
00:02:21,938 --> 00:02:26,795
times, and this is in a different shade of yellow, times s minus 20.

29
00:02:26,795 --> 00:02:30,729
This is profit as a function of selling price.

30
00:02:30,729 --> 00:02:34,652
And now we can just, let me be very careful here, let me be very care--

31
00:02:34,652 --> 00:02:38,313
This is just, this is q right here, and so this whole thing is q.

32
00:02:38,313 --> 00:02:43,010
Wanna make sure we're multiplying this whole expression times this entire expression right over there,

33
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,687
and so let's do that.

34
00:02:44,687 --> 00:02:47,390
So this is going to be equal to,

35
00:02:47,436 --> 00:02:50,282
this is going to be equal to -30 s.

36
00:02:50,282 --> 00:02:54,313
So let me just distribute it out. This is going to be -30 s,

37
00:02:54,313 --> 00:02:59,205
times s minus 20, times this whole thing, we're taking this whole term,

38
00:02:59,205 --> 00:03:01,590
we're first multiplying it times -30 s.

39
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:07,390
And then we're gonna take this whole term and then multiply it by 800, s minus 20.

40
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:11,990
And so this gives us, this is equal to -30 s times s, we have to distribute again,

41
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:24,898
-30 s squared, -30 s times -20, is going to be positive, positive, positive 600 s.

42
00:03:24,898 --> 00:03:29,185
And then we have 800 times s, so that's plus 800 s,

43
00:03:29,185 --> 00:03:36,487
and then 800 times -20, so that is -8 times 2 is 16,

44
00:03:36,487 --> 00:03:40,600
and we have one, two, three zeros, one, two, three, zeros.

45
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,215
And if we simplify we can add these two terms right over here.

46
00:03:44,215 --> 00:03:52,852
We get -30 s squared plus 1400 s minus 16000.

47
00:03:52,852 --> 00:03:59,513
So we now, we've now expressed, we've now expressed, our profit as a function of selling price.

48
00:03:59,513 --> 00:04:01,979
And this is actually going to be a downward opening parabola,

49
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:06,333
and we can tell that because the coefficient on the second degree term,

50
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,359
on the quadratic term, is negative.

51
00:04:08,359 --> 00:04:13,692
So if we were to graph this, if we were to graph this...

52
00:04:13,692 --> 00:04:17,646
So over here--let me draw a better graph than that.

53
00:04:17,646 --> 00:04:20,508
Over here, this axis right here is going to be the selling price,

54
00:04:20,508 --> 00:04:22,969
And this is profit which is a function of selling price.

55
00:04:22,969 --> 00:04:29,769
This graph, this equation right over here, is going to look like this, is going to look something like this.

56
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:33,748
We already saw the selling price--let me write, just write it this way.

57
00:04:33,748 --> 00:04:38,985
So let me just--is going to look something like this.

58
00:04:38,985 --> 00:04:42,636
I don't know what the exact equation is gonna look like, but it's gonna be downward opening.

59
00:04:42,636 --> 00:04:46,159
And what we wanna do is maximize the profit.

60
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:49,415
We wanna find this maximum point right over here.

61
00:04:49,415 --> 00:04:54,287
You could do it with calculus, if you had, if you had calculus at your, at your, at your fingertips.

62
00:04:54,287 --> 00:04:57,754
Or you could just recognize this is the vertex of the parabola.

63
00:04:57,754 --> 00:05:01,185
And you could, you could figure out the vertex by putting in the vertex form,

64
00:05:01,185 --> 00:05:04,979
but the fastest way is to just know that the normally the x coordinate,

65
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:11,231
or the s coordinate, the s coordinate, of the vertex is going to be -b over 2 a.

66
00:05:11,231 --> 00:05:13,944
And if we wanna figure out what -b over 2 a is,

67
00:05:13,944 --> 00:05:18,759
we just take the--this is the b right over here so it's a -b

68
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:26,390
so it's -1400 over 2 a, over 2 times -30,

69
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:32,575
which is equal to -1400 over -60.

70
00:05:32,575 --> 00:05:36,513
Negatives cancel out, we could divide the numerator and the denominator by 10.

71
00:05:36,513 --> 00:05:40,210
So this is the same thing as a 140 over 6.

72
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:46,348
We can divide the numerator and the denominator by 3, or by, by 2.

73
00:05:46,348 --> 00:05:51,571
And you get 70, you get 70 over 3.

74
00:05:51,741 --> 00:05:56,913
And then we can just divide that, so 3 goes into 70,

75
00:05:56,913 --> 00:06:00,536
3 goes into 7 two times, 2 times 3 is 6.

76
00:06:00,536 --> 00:06:06,298
Subtract, you get a difference of 1, bring down the zero, 3 goes into 10 three times,

77
00:06:06,298 --> 00:06:11,013
3 times 3 is 9, subtract, you have, bring down, you get a 1.

78
00:06:11,013 --> 00:06:15,067
Now we're in the decimals, we bring down another zero, it becomes a 10 again,

79
00:06:15,129 --> 00:06:18,625
3 goes into 10 three times, I think you see where this is going.

80
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:25,662
It's 23.3 repeating times. If we just keep doing this, we'll just keep getting more, more, more threes.

81
00:06:25,662 --> 00:06:30,141
Or if we just wanted to round to the nearest penny, since we're talking about selling something,

82
00:06:30,141 --> 00:06:38,748
this optimal profit, this optimal profit, will happen at a selling price of $23 and 30,

83
00:06:38,748 --> 00:06:42,329
$23 and 33 cents.

84
00:06:42,329 --> 99:59:59,999
That will optimize the yearly profit.
