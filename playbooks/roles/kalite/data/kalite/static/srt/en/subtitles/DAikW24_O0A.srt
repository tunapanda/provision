1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,580
   

2
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:05,070
78 is 15% of what number?

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:10,060
So there's some unknown number
out there, and if we take 15%

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:13,000
of that number, we
will get 78.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,079
So let's just call that
unknown number x.

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:24,510
And we know that if we take
15% of x, so multiply x by

7
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:29,990
15%, we will get 78.

8
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:34,330
And now we just literally
have to solve for x.

9
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:37,880
Now, 15% mathematically, you
can deal directly with

10
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,600
percentages, but it's
much easier if it's

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,240
written as a decimal.

12
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:48,350
And we know that 15% is the
same thing as 15 per 100.

13
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:50,040
That's literally per cent.

14
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,560
Cent means 100, which is
the same thing as 0.15.

15
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,060
This is literally
15 hundredths.

16
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:03,600
So we could rewrite this as
0.15 times some unknown

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:11,510
number, times x,
is equal to 78.

18
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:15,570
And now we can divide both sides
of this equation by 0.15

19
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,460
to solve for x.

20
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,130
So you divide the left side
by 0.15, and I'm literally

21
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:24,140
picking 0.15 to divide both
sides because that's what I

22
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,030
have out here in
front of the x.

23
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,580
So if I'm multiplying something
by 0.15 and then I

24
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,700
divided by 0.15, I'll just
be left with an x here.

25
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,110
That's the whole motivation.

26
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:35,680
If I do it to the left-hand
side, I have to do it to the

27
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,930
right-hand side.

28
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,420
   

29
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,460
These cancel out, and
I get x is equal to

30
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:47,600
78 divided by 0.15.

31
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,000
Now, we have to figure
out what that is.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,900
If we had a calculator, pretty
straightforward, but let's

33
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,860
actually work it out.

34
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:58,460
So we have 78 divided by,
and it's going to be

35
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:01,840
some decimal number.

36
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,870
It's going to be
larger than 78.

37
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,790
But let's figure out what it
ends up being, so let's throw

38
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,050
some zeroes out there.

39
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,490
It's not going to be
a whole number.

40
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:12,860
And we're dividing it by 0.15.

41
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,030
Now, to simplify things, let's
multiply both this numerator

42
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:19,330
and this denominator by 100,
and that's so that 0.15

43
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:20,720
becomes 15.

44
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,530
So 0.15 times 100 is 15.

45
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:28,220
We're just moving the decimal
to the right.

46
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,500
Let me put that in
a new color.

47
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,470
Right there, that's where
our decimals goes.

48
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,600
Let me erase the other one,
so we don't get confused.

49
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,480
If we did that for the 15,
we also have to do

50
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,520
that for the 78.

51
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:42,810
So if you move the decimal two
to the right, one, two, it

52
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:48,350
becomes 7,800.

53
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:52,530
So one way to think about it, 78
divided by 0.15 is the same

54
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:56,880
thing as 7,800 divided by 15,
multiplying the numerator and

55
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,240
the denominator by 100.

56
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,890
So let's figure out
what this is.

57
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:06,140
15 does not go into 7, So you
could do it zero times and you

58
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,920
can do all that, or you can just
say, OK, that's not going

59
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,960
to give us anything.

60
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,210
So then how many times
does 15 go into 78?

61
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,040
So let's think about it.

62
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,640
15 goes into 60 four times.

63
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,770
15 times 5 is 75.

64
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:23,470
That looks about right,
so we say five times.

65
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,550
5 times 15.

66
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:27,810
5 times 5 is 25.

67
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,150
Put the 2 up there.

68
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:31,920
5 times 1 is 5, plus 2 is 7.

69
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,040
75, you subtract.

70
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,890
78 minus 75 five is 3.

71
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,260
Bring down a zero.

72
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,220
   

73
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,220
15 goes into 30 exactly
two times.

74
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,430
2 times 15 is 30.

75
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,310
Subtract.

76
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,480
No remainder.

77
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,040
Bring down the next zero.

78
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,750
We're still to the left
of the decimal point.

79
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,470
The decimal point is
right over here.

80
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:57,170
If we write it up here, which
we should, it's right over

81
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,670
there, so we have one
more place to go.

82
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,730
So we bring down
this next zero.

83
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:03,330
15 goes into 0 zero times.

84
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,520
0 times 15 is 0.

85
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,640
Subtract.

86
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,030
No remainder.

87
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:13,670
So 78 divided by 0.15
is exactly 520.

88
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,510
So x is equal to 520.

89
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:21,170
So 78 is 15% of 520.

90
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,500
And if we want to use some of
the terminology that you might

91
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,945
see in a math class, the 15%
is obviously the percent.

92
00:04:26,945 --> 00:04:31,990
   

93
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:36,420
520, or what number before we
figured out it was 520, that's

94
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,220
what we're taking the
percentage of.

95
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,410
This is sometimes referred
to as the base.

96
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:43,520
   

97
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,370
And then when you take some
percentage of the base, you

98
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,850
get what's sometimes referred
to as the amount.

99
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:53,350
So in this circumstance,
78 would be the amount.

100
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:56,160
You could view it as the amount
is the percentage of

101
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,540
the base, but we were able
to figure that out.

102
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:01,040
It's nice to know those, if
that's the terminology you use

103
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,570
in your class.

104
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:02,790
But the important thing
is to be able

105
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:03,960
just answer this question.

106
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:09,750
And it makes sense, because
15% is a very small

107
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,350
percentage.

108
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:13,230
If 78 is a small percentage of
some number, that means that

109
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:18,020
number has to be pretty big, and
our answer gels with that.

110
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,530
This looks about right.

111
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:25,030
78 is exactly 15% of 520.

112
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:25,934
