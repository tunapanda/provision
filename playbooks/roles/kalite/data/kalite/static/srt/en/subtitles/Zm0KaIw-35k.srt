1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:05,510
Jayda takes 3 hours to deliver
189 newspapers

2
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:06,840
on her paper route.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:11,080
What is the rate per
hour at which she

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,040
delivers the newspaper?

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,960
So this first sentence tells us
that she delivers,

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,536
or she takes, 3 hours

7
00:00:20,536 --> 00:00:26,162
to deliver 189 newspapers.

8
00:00:26,162 --> 00:00:32,840
So you have 3 hours for
every 189 newspapers.

9
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,970
That's what the first
sentence told us.

10
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:37,660
But we want to figure out
the rate per hour,

11
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,130
or the newspapers per hour,
so we can really just flip this rate

12
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:42,170
right here.

13
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:43,856
So if we were to just flip it,

14
00:00:43,856 --> 00:00:50,122
we would have 189 newspapers

15
00:00:51,812 --> 00:00:57,321
for every 3 hours,

16
00:00:57,321 --> 00:00:59,860
which is really the same information.

17
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,610
We're just flipping what's in
the numerator and what's in

18
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:03,860
the denominator.

19
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:07,340
Now we want to write it in as
simple as possible form,

20
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,940
and let's see if this top number
is divisible by 3.

21
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:14,240
1 plus 8 is 9, plus 9 is 18.

22
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,810
So that is divisible by 3.

23
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,120
So let's divide this numerator
and this denominator by 3 to

24
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,500
simplify things.

25
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,930
So if you divide 189 by 3.

26
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:25,300
Let's do it over on the
side right here.

27
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,450
3 goes into 189.

28
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,500
3 goes into 18 six times.

29
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,600
6 times 3 is 18.

30
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,720
Subtract.

31
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,190
Bring down the 9.

32
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,220
18 minus 18 was nothing.

33
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:40,380
3 goes into 9 exactly
three times.

34
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,150
3 times 3 is 9, no remainder.

35
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:50,880
So if you divide 189 by 3, you
get 63, and if you divide 3 by

36
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,390
3, you're going to get 1.

37
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:54,710
You have to divide both the
numerator and the denominator

38
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,440
by the same number.

39
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:00,490
So now we have 63 newspapers
for every 1 hour.

40
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:06,186
Or we could write this as 63
over 1 newspapers per hour.

41
00:02:06,516 --> 00:02:12,264
So we could write this as 63
over 1 newspapers...

42
00:02:12,644 --> 00:02:16,072
per hour. Per, 1 hour.

43
00:02:16,072 --> 00:02:20,280
Or we could write this as 63,
because 63 over 1 is the same

44
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:30,230
thing as 63 newspapers
per hour.
