1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,580
In one game, a code made using
different colors is created by

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:07,340
one player, the codemaker,
and the other player, the

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,670
codebreaker, tries to
guess the code.

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:12,150
The codemaker gives hints about
whether the colors are

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,840
correct and in the
right position.

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:14,890
All right.

7
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:17,910
The possible colors are blue--
let me underline these in the

8
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:31,340
actual colors-- blue, yellow,
white, red, orange and green.

9
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:33,370
Green is already written in
green, but I'll underline it

10
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:34,120
in green again.

11
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,780
And green.

12
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,530
How many 4-color codes
can be made if the

13
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:39,970
colors cannot be repeated?

14
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:42,040
To some degree, this whole
paragraph in the beginning

15
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,590
doesn't even matter.

16
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:46,120
If we're just choosing from--
let's see, we're choosing

17
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,170
from-- how many colors
are there?

18
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:52,230
There's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 colors,
and we're going to

19
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:53,500
pick 4 of them.

20
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,750
How many 4-color codes
can be made if the

21
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,350
colors cannot be repeated?

22
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,470
And since these are codes, we're
going to assume that

23
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:15,050
blue, red, yellow and green,
that this-- that that is

24
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:23,380
different than green, red,
yellow and blue.

25
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,940
We're going to assume that these
are not the same code.

26
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,970
Even though we've picked the
same 4 colors, we're going to

27
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:31,130
assume that these are 2
different codes, and that

28
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:32,410
makes sense because we're
dealing with codes.

29
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:37,080
So these are different codes.

30
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,750
So this would count as 2
different codes right here,

31
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:44,120
even though we've picked
the same actual colors.

32
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,530
The same 4 colors,
we've picked them

33
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:46,310
in different orders.

34
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,290
Now, with that out of the way,
let's think about how many

35
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,700
different ways we can
pick 4 colors.

36
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,530
So let's say we have
4 slots here.

37
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:57,920
1 slot, 2 slot, 3 slot
and 4 slots.

38
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,290
And at first, we care only
about, how many ways can we

39
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,830
pick a color for that slot right
there, that first slot?

40
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,740
We haven't picked
any colors yet.

41
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:09,410
Well, we have 6 possible colors,
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

42
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:12,310
So there's going to be 6
different possibilities for

43
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,680
this slot right there.

44
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,240
So let's put a 6 right there.

45
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,520
Now, they told us that the
colors cannot be repeated, so

46
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,960
whatever color is in this slot,
we're going to take it

47
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,260
out of the possible colors.

48
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,660
So now that we've taken that
color out, how many

49
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:29,430
possibilities are when we go
to this slot, when we go to

50
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,640
the next slot?

51
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,030
How many possibilities
when we go to the

52
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,240
next slot right here?

53
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,280
Well, we took 1 of the 6 out for
the first slot, so there's

54
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,300
only 5 possibilities here.

55
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,140
And by the same logic when we
go to the third slot, we've

56
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:44,480
used up 2 of the slots-- 2 of
the colors already, so there

57
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,940
would only 4 possible
colors left.

58
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:49,940
And then for the last slot, we
would've used up 3 of the

59
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,840
colors, so there's only
3 possibilities left.

60
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,350
So if we think about all of the
possibilities, all of the

61
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,790
permutations-- and permutations
are when you

62
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,880
think about all the
possibilities and you do care

63
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,910
about order; where you say that
this is different than

64
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:05,750
this-- this is a different
permutation than this.

65
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:09,420
So all of the different
permutations here, when you

66
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:14,190
pick 4 colors out of a possible
of 6 colors, it's

67
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:18,680
going to be 6 possibilities for
the first 1, times 5 for

68
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:24,900
the second bucket, times 4 for
the third or the third bucket

69
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,130
of the third position,
times 3.

70
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:32,950
So 6 times 5 is 30, times
4 is… times 3.

71
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,776
So 30 times 12.

72
00:03:34,776 --> 00:03:40,950
So this is 30 times 12, which is
equal to there are 360 possible

73
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:43,680
4-color codes.
