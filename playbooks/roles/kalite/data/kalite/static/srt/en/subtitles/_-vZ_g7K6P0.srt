1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
   

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,890
I'm sure many of y'all have
already heard of the molecule

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:08,980
DNA, and it stands for
deoxyribonucleic acid.

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:11,610
I wrote it out ahead of time
to spare you the pain of

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,740
watching me spell this
in real time.

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,860
But it is-- and I think you
already have an idea.

7
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:21,170
This is the basic unit of
heredity, or it's what codes

8
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:23,790
all of our genetic
information.

9
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,770
And what I want to do in this
video-- because I think that's

10
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:26,910
kind of common knowledge.

11
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,240
That's popular knowledge that,
oh, everything that makes my

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,640
hair black or my eyes blue or
whatever, that's all somehow

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,330
encoded in our DNA.

14
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:39,490
But what I want to do in this
video is give you an idea of

15
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:43,020
how something like DNA, a
molecule, can actually code

16
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,500
for what we are.

17
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,390
How does the information, one,
get stored in this type of a

18
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,240
molecule, then how does that
actually turn into the

19
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,600
proteins that make up our
enzymes and our organs and our

20
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,770
brain cells and everything else
that really make us us?

21
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:04,400
So this is a computer graphics
representation of DNA, and I'm

22
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,860
sure many of y'all have heard
of the double helix.

23
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:11,400
   

24
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,450
And that's in reference to the
structure that DNA takes.

25
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,860
And you can see here it's
a double helix.

26
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,560
As you can see here, you have
two of these lines, and

27
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,450
they're intertwined
with each other.

28
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:27,550
You see there, that's one of
them, and then you see another

29
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:30,760
one intertwined like that.

30
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,190
And then they're connected by--
you can almost view it as

31
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:38,780
like these bridges between the
two helixes, and they twist

32
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,580
around each other.

33
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:41,670
I think you get the idea.

34
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,950
So the double helix just
describes the structure, the

35
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:47,710
shape that DNA takes, and
it leads to all sorts of

36
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:50,800
interesting repercussions in
terms of how heredity takes

37
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:55,330
place and how natural selection
and variation might

38
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:56,340
take place as well.

39
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,860
And actually, in the future, I
do want to actually read with

40
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:04,350
you Watson and Crick's paper on
the double helix where they

41
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,830
essentially talk about
their discovery.

42
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,669
The best thing about that paper,
besides the fact that

43
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:11,120
it was probably one of the
biggest discoveries in the

44
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,370
history of mankind, is that the
paper is only a page and a

45
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,950
half long, and it goes to my
general view that if you have

46
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,440
something good to say,
it shouldn't take you

47
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,510
that long to say it.

48
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,880
But with that said, let's think
a little bit about how

49
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,600
this can actually generate the
proteins and whatever else

50
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,240
that make up all of us.

51
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:34,290
So right here this is a
zoomed-up version of that

52
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:37,140
graphic that I just showed you a
little bit earlier, and this

53
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,620
is each of the helixes.

54
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:44,740
So if this is the magenta side,
if you unwound this

55
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,530
helix-- right now it shows it
in its wound state, but if I

56
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:54,010
unwind this helix, one side
would maybe be this magenta

57
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:58,350
side of our helix and
then one side is

58
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,880
this green side, right?

59
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,400
And if you twist it up,
you get back to

60
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,110
this drawing up here.

61
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,650
And then these bridges that you
see in this drawing in the

62
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:10,870
double helix, those are these
connections right here.

63
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,120
These are the bridges.

64
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,040
   

65
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:21,410
Now, what allows us to code
information is that the blocks

66
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:25,030
that make up the bridges are
made of different molecules.

67
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,250
And the four different molecules
that are made up in

68
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:31,670
DNA are adenine-- and
it's written here

69
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,390
on this little chart.

70
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:34,370
I got all of this from
Wikipedia, so if you want more

71
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:36,310
information I encourage
you to go there.

72
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:39,200
Adenine, that's up here.

73
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,240
This is the molecular structure
of adenine.

74
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:47,270
It's connected to a sugar
right here, ribose.

75
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,900
I won't go into a deoxyribose.

76
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,600
And then you have your
phosphate group.

77
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,840
But these kind of form the
backbone of the DNA: the sugar

78
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,770
and the phosphate groups.

79
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,420
And I'm not going to go into
the microbiology of it,

80
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,090
because that's not important
right now to understanding

81
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:04,770
just how does this intuitively
code for what we are.

82
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:07,620
So along the backbone, which
is identical, and

83
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,240
we'll talk about it.

84
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,550
They run in different
directions.

85
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,960
It's called antiparallel,
so they label the ends.

86
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,500
And I'm not going to go into
detail there, but the

87
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,540
important thing are
these bases here.

88
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:26,180
So you have adenine, and adenine
pairs with thymine,

89
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,635
and you see that up here.

90
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:31,470
If you have an adenine molecule
here, an adenine base

91
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,550
here, it'll pair with
thymine, and this is

92
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:34,590
called the base pair.

93
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,500
Adenine and thymine pair
with each other.

94
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,470
If you have thymine, it's going
to pair with adenine.

95
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,790
And then you have guanine and
it pairs with cytosine.

96
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:47,110
   

97
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,480
And the names of these, you
should know these names, just

98
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:54,200
because they are almost-- well,
if you ever enter any

99
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,550
discussion about DNA
and base pairs,

100
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:59,310
this is expected knowledge.

101
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:02,250
But the names of the molecules
and how they're structured,

102
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,840
not important just yet.

103
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,290
But what's important is the fact
that there are four of

104
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:10,070
them and that they essentially
code information.

105
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,560
So you can view one of these
strands in kind of a

106
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,410
simplified way.

107
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:17,280
You can just view it as a strand
of-- so this one, if it

108
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:24,600
has an adenine and then
it has a cytosine,

109
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,370
then it has a guanine.

110
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:27,050
That's a guanine.

111
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:29,290
They did it in purple.

112
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:33,050
And then it has a-- oh, no, it
has a thymine, not a guanine.

113
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:36,090
So it has a thymine in
purple, and then in

114
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,160
blue, it has a guanine.

115
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,870
So this strand right
here codes ACTG.

116
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:44,470
And if you were to code the
opposite side of the strand,

117
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,780
you could immediately-- I don't
even have to look here.

118
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,550
I can look at this side and
say, OK, adenine will pair

119
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:58,050
with thymine, cytosine pairs
with guanine, thymine pairs

120
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:01,340
with adenine, and guanine
pairs with cytosine.

121
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,530
So they're complementary
strands.

122
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,980
So if you think about
it, they're really

123
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,540
coding the same thing.

124
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,980
If you have one of them, you
have all of the information

125
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,820
for the other.

126
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:15,820
Now, in our DNA, in a human's
DNA, you might say, hey, Sal,

127
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:22,120
how do I go from these little
chains of these molecules?

128
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,750
How does that turn into me?

129
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,090
How does that turn into
this complex organism?

130
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:30,520
And the simple answer is, well,
the human genome has

131
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,505
three billion of these
base pairs.

132
00:06:32,505 --> 00:06:39,120
   

133
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,230
And that's actually just in
half of your chromosomes.

134
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:44,040
And I'll tell you, maybe in this
video or a future video,

135
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,540
why we only consider half of
your chromosomes, and that's

136
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:53,150
because essentially you have
a pair of every chromosome.

137
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:55,180
I'll talk in more detail
about that.

138
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:58,890
And this number, to some people,
they might say, it

139
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:04,420
only takes three billion base
pairs to describe who I am?

140
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:08,260
And some people would say, wow,
it takes three billion

141
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,490
base pairs to describe
who I am.

142
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:11,060
I never thought I was
that complex.

143
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,390
So depending on your point of
view, this is either a large

144
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,560
or small number.

145
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,810
But when you take these three
billion base pairs, you're

146
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:19,900
actually encoding all of the
information that it takes to

147
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,560
make in this case
a human being.

148
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,330
And actually it turns out a
lot of primates don't have

149
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:29,450
that many different base pairs
than human beings.

150
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,790
The amazing thing is even things
like roundworms and

151
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:38,000
fruit flies also number in a
surprisingly large fraction of

152
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,600
the base pairs of
a human being.

153
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,680
Maybe I'll do another
video where I go

154
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,720
into comparative biology.

155
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:48,370
But how do these base pairs
actually lead to proteins?

156
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:49,530
I mean, it's fair enough.

157
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:50,470
That's information.

158
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,100
It's like you can view these
as ones and zeroes in some

159
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,690
type of computer language, but
really they're not just ones

160
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:58,140
and zeroes, because they can
take on four different values.

161
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:01,860
They can take on an A, a T, a
C or a G, so you could think

162
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,930
of them as zero, ones, twos
and threes, but I won't go

163
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:06,840
into that whole aspect
of it just now.

164
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,340
So how does that actually
code information?

165
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:17,690
So DNA when it actually
transcribes something-- the

166
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:24,345
process is called transcription,
and I'm going

167
00:08:24,345 --> 00:08:27,000
to do a pretty gross
simplification of it, but I

168
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,450
think it'll give you the gist of
how it codes for proteins.

169
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:32,480
So what happens when
transcription happens is that

170
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,980
these two strands split up, and
one of the strands-- let

171
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:36,890
me just take one of them.

172
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:37,830
Let's say it looks like this.

173
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:39,580
I'll do it all in one color.

174
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:47,930
Let's say it's just ATGGACG--
I'm just making up stuff-- TA.

175
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:50,790
Let's say that that's the strand
that got split up.

176
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:54,080
And what happens is
it transcribes--

177
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,060
and I won't say itself.

178
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:59,310
There's a whole bunch of enzymes
and proteins and a

179
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:03,060
whole bunch of chemical
reactions that have to happen,

180
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:07,050
but this DNA essentially
transcribes a

181
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:10,020
complementary mRNA.

182
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,260
And I'll introduce RNA.

183
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,810
   

184
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:17,930
It's essentially the exact same
thing as-- well, the word

185
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:21,630
is ribonucleic acid, so it's
literally-- you get rid of the

186
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:24,640
deoxy, so you can kind of say
it's got its oxy, and it's

187
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,000
ribonucleic acid, but it's
very similar to DNA.

188
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,960
It codes in the exact
same way.

189
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:37,260
The only difference between RNA,
instead of a thymine, it

190
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,750
has something called a uracil.

191
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,760
So every place where you would
have expected a thymine, you

192
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,520
would have expected a T,
you'll now see a U.

193
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:51,260
So, for example, if this is the
DNA strand, then an RNA,

194
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:54,520
an mRNA, in a messenger RNA
strand, will be built

195
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,780
complementary to this.

196
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,070
So it'll be built-- let's see.

197
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,310
With A, you'd normally have
thymine when you're talking

198
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:03,180
DNA, but now we're talking RNA,
so it'll be a uracil,

199
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:09,260
then an adenine, cytosine,
cytosine, uracil, then we got

200
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:14,070
a guanine, a cytosine,
an adenine, and then

201
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:14,770
we'll have a uracil.

202
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:18,230
So this is the mRNA
strand here.

203
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:19,820
And all of this is occurring
inside the

204
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,500
nucleus of your cells.

205
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,670
And we'll do a whole series of
videos in the future about the

206
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:30,995
structure of our cells, but I
think most of us know that our

207
00:10:30,995 --> 00:10:34,910
cells-- and I'll talk more
about eukaryotic and

208
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:37,220
prokaryotic organisms in the
future, but most complex

209
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,860
organisms, they have a cell
nucleus where we have all of

210
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,540
our chromosomes that contain
all of our DNA.

211
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:48,690
And so this mRNA then detaches
itself from the DNA that it

212
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,400
was transcribed from, and then
it leaves the nucleus, and it

213
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,950
goes to these structures
called ribosomes.

214
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:57,360
I'm oversimplifying it a
little bit, but at the

215
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,510
ribosomes, this mRNA is
translated into proteins.

216
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:03,450
So let me do that.

217
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:06,360
So let's say this is the mRNA.

218
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,780
It was transcribed from that
DNA, so let me get

219
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:12,320
rid of that DNA now.

220
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,300
I got rid of the DNA.

221
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,990
This is the mRNA that we were
able to transcribe from that

222
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:19,220
DNA, and they have these
other things called

223
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,600
tRNA or transfer RNA.

224
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,230
And what these are--
and this is the

225
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:24,930
really interesting part.

226
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:28,230
So you may or may not know that
pretty much everything we

227
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,200
are is made up of proteins.

228
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,610
And these proteins, the building
blocks of proteins

229
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:33,790
are amino acids.

230
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:37,380
And for those of you who like
to lift weights, I'm sure

231
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:41,120
you've seen ads for amino
acid supplements and

232
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,640
things of the like.

233
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,420
And the reason why they talk
about amino acids is because

234
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:49,400
those are the building
blocks of proteins.

235
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,200
My son actually has an allergy
to milk protein, so we had to

236
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,690
get him a formula that was just
pure amino acids, just

237
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:58,520
all of the milk proteins
broken down.

238
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:04,260
So if you look at a protein,
it's actually a chain of these

239
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:07,240
amino acids and usually
a fairly long chain.

240
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,750
We'll look at some protein
structures in the very near

241
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,090
future, just to give you
an idea of things.

242
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:17,550
It's a very long chain of these
amino acids, and there

243
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:20,700
are actually 20 different
amino acids.

244
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,760
Twenty different amino acids are
pretty much the structure

245
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,990
of all of our proteins.

246
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:26,240
Let me write that.

247
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,790
   

248
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:34,070
So a very obvious question is
how can these things code for

249
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:36,050
20 different amino acids?

250
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:40,370
I can only have four different
things in this little bucket

251
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:41,410
right here.

252
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:44,880
And then you just have to go
back to your combinatorics, or

253
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,510
if you can't go back to it
to watch the playlist on

254
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:51,290
probability and combinatorics,
and say, OK, there's only four

255
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:56,090
ways that I can have for
each of these bases.

256
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:58,600
There's only four different
bases that I can have here,

257
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,540
either an adenine guanine,
cytosine or, depending on

258
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,770
whether we're talking
about DNA or RNA,

259
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:06,980
a uracil or a thymine.

260
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,810
But how can we increase
the combinations?

261
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:13,450
Well, if we include two of them,
if we include two bases,

262
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:16,350
then how many combinations
can we have?

263
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:18,260
Well, we have four possibilities
here, then we'd

264
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:22,190
have four possibilities here, so
we'd have 16 possibilities.

265
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,850
But that's still not enough.

266
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:27,800
That's still not enough to code
for one of 20 amino acids

267
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,080
to say, hey, this is going to
code for amino acid number

268
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,950
five, and we'll talk more about
their actual names.

269
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:34,820
So what do we have to do?

270
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,740
Well, we have to use
three of them.

271
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:40,040
So three of them, there's
actually four times four times

272
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:44,020
four possibilities here, so
they could code for 64

273
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,610
different things.

274
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:49,170
They could take on 64 different
combinations or

275
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:51,670
permutations, this
UAC right here.

276
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:54,990
So if we have three of these
bases, we can actually code

277
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:56,400
for an amino acid.

278
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,580
Actually, it's overkill, because
we can actually have

279
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:02,510
64 combinations here, and there
are only 20 amino acids,

280
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:05,410
so we can even have redundant
combinations code for

281
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:06,470
different amino acids.

282
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:11,210
For example, we might say
that, and this isn't the

283
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:14,350
actual code, but maybe UAC, and
I should look these up.

284
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:18,020
This codes for amino
acid number 1.

285
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:24,730
And if it was AAU, then this
codes for amino acid number 2.

286
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:29,430
And if I have-- I mean, I
think you get the idea.

287
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:35,110
If I have GGG, this codes for
amino acid number 10.

288
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:38,490
And what happens is when this
messenger RNA leaves the

289
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:41,330
nucleus, it goes to the
ribosomes, and at the

290
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:44,620
ribosomes-- we're going to look
at that diagram in a few

291
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:49,470
seconds-- but at the ribosomes--
let me take my

292
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:53,940
same mRNA molecule.

293
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,570
And they're much longer than
what I'm showing here.

294
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:57,700
This is just a fraction
of an mRNA molecule.

295
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:01,080
   

296
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,700
So I'll take my mRNA molecule,
and what they do is they

297
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,630
essentially act as a template
for tRNA molecules.

298
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:12,270
And tRNA molecules are these
molecules that are attached to

299
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:15,310
the-- they're almost like the
trucks for the amino acids.

300
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:18,610
So let's say I have some amino
acid right here, and then I

301
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:22,370
have another amino acid that's
right here like that, and then

302
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:25,110
I have another amino acid
that's like that.

303
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:27,300
They'll be attached
to tRNA molecules.

304
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:33,880
So let's say that this tRNA
molecule has on it-- so this

305
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:37,380
amino acid is attached to a
tRNA molecule that has the

306
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:42,570
code on it A-- let me do
it in a darker color.

307
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:48,907
It has the code AUG.

308
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:48,907
   

309
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:56,900
This one right here has
the code-- let me

310
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,650
pick another one.

311
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:58,900
Let's say it has GAC.

312
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,290
So what's going to happen?

313
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:07,210
When you're in the ribosome, and
it's a complex situation,

314
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:09,750
but actually what's happening
isn't too fancy.

315
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:14,380
This tRNA, it wants to bond
to this part of the mRNA.

316
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:14,840
Why?

317
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:19,670
Because adenine bonds with
uracil, uracil bonds with

318
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:22,940
adenine, and guanine bonds with
cyotsine, so it'll pull

319
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:23,930
up right here.

320
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:25,970
It'll pull up right next to this
thing, and actually, I

321
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:29,920
should probably-- well, I don't
know if I can rotate it.

322
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,530
But it'll just pull up
right here and attach

323
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:33,800
to this mRNA molecule.

324
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,060
And this right here is tRNA.

325
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,930
   

326
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,450
This is mRNA.

327
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:40,410
And the names don't matter.

328
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:42,510
I really just want to give you
the big picture idea of how

329
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,490
the proteins are actually
formed.

330
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:45,960
And this is an amino acid.

331
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,600
I don't know, let's call it
amino acid 1, amino acid 5,

332
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,090
amino acid 20.

333
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:54,670
This guy, he's going to
pull up right here.

334
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:57,530
The guanine is attracted to the
cytosine, and if you watch

335
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:59,740
the chemistry videos, these are
actually hydrogen bonds

336
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,410
that form the base pairs.

337
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:05,380
Adenine, wants to pull up to
uracil, cytosine to guanine,

338
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,579
and so on and so forth.

339
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:08,430
And so once all of these
guys have pulled

340
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:09,970
up-- let me do that.

341
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:13,030
So once you've pulled up, let's
say that this is-- I

342
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,740
could do it up here.

343
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,720
This is my mRNA molecule.

344
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,180
I'm not going to draw the
specifics right there.

345
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:24,339
My little tRNA's pull up, pull
up next to it, and they each

346
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:26,470
hold a payload, right?

347
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:29,250
So this first one holds this
payload right here of this

348
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,230
amino acid.

349
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:33,840
The second one holds this
payload of this amino acid and

350
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,800
so forth and so on.

351
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,030
And so it might keep going,
and there's another green

352
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:40,870
amino acid here.

353
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:43,230
They really don't have those
colors, but I'm just-- just

354
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,300
for the sake of simplicity
like that.

355
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,880
And then the amino acids bond
to each other when they're

356
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,600
held like that close
to each other.

357
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,360
This doesn't happen
all by itself.

358
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,860
The ribosome serves a purpose,
and there are enzymes that

359
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:58,210
facilitate this process, but
once these guys bond together,

360
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:01,160
the tRNA detaches,
and you have this

361
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,330
chain of amino acids.

362
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:08,590
And then the chain of amino
acids starts to bend around so

363
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:10,910
they have all of these-- and
it's actually a fascinating--

364
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:14,920
I mean, people spend their lives
studying how proteins

365
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,680
fold, and that's actually where
they get most of their

366
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,770
structural properties.

367
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:21,030
It's not just the chain of the
amino acids, but what's more

368
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:23,660
important is how these amino
acids actually fold.

369
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:26,880
So once you fold them, they form
these really ultracomplex

370
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,990
patterns based on what amino
acid is attracted to what

371
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:33,180
other amino acid in these
very intricate

372
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,820
three-dimensional shapes.

373
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:38,250
And what I took here from
Wikipedia is these are some

374
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:38,920
amino acids.

375
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:44,150
And just to be able to relate
this to the DNA, this right

376
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:45,220
here is insulin.

377
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:49,850
It's key in our ability to
process glucose in our body.

378
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:51,300
So this right here is insulin.

379
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,430
It's a hormone.

380
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,970
So sometimes you hear people
talk about your immune system.

381
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:57,110
Sometimes you hear people
talking about your endocrine

382
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:00,200
system and hormones, sometimes
your digestive system.

383
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:05,700
This is hemoglobin, what
essentially transports our

384
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,090
oxygen in our blood.

385
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:10,020
But all of these things are
proteins, and all these

386
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,510
little, little folds you see,
these are all little amino-- I

387
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:16,520
mean, they're just little
dots of amino acids.

388
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,810
Some of these are multiple
chains of amino acids kind of

389
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:22,250
fitting together like a big
puzzle, but some of them or

390
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,950
just single chains
of amino acids.

391
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:27,310
For insulin right here, this
is 50 amino acids.

392
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:30,850
And then once the chain forms,
it all bundles together and

393
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:34,710
forms this little blob like you
see, but the shape of that

394
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:38,350
blob is super important for
insulin being able to perform

395
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:41,870
the function that it needs to
perform in our systems.

396
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:47,040
But this right here is
approximately 50-- I forgot

397
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,145
the exact number--
amino acids.

398
00:19:49,145 --> 00:19:53,210
   

399
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:59,670
This right here, this
immunoglobulin G, which is

400
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:01,760
part of our immune
system, this is

401
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:09,700
roughly 1,500 amino acids.

402
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,160
So how much DNA or how
many base pairs

403
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:12,990
had to code for this?

404
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:15,180
Well, three times
as much, right?

405
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:19,350
Because you have to have three
base pairs that code for one

406
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:21,490
amino acid, and actually, three
base pairs, this is

407
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:27,180
called a codon, because it
codes for amino acids.

408
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:29,380
So three base pairs
make a codon.

409
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:32,170
So if you have 50 amino acids
that make up insulin, that

410
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:34,230
means you're going to have to
have 50 codons, which means

411
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:39,940
you have to have 150 bases
or 150 of these

412
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,770
A's and G's and T's.

413
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:45,100
If you have 1,500 amino acids,
that means you're going to

414
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,420
have to have 1,500 codons, which
means you're going to

415
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:54,660
have roughly 4,500 of these base
pairs that code for it.

416
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:59,280
Now, there are some notions that
get confused a lot, so I

417
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,480
went to kind of the smallest
level of our DNA right here,

418
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,180
and this is the level at which--
well, this is RNA that

419
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:08,300
I'm pointing to right there, but
this is the smallest level

420
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,580
of DNA, and that's the level
at which the information is

421
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,320
actually coded.

422
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,490
But how does that relate to
things like genes and

423
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:16,700
chromosomes and things
that you might talk

424
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,183
about in other contexts?

425
00:21:18,183 --> 00:21:20,860
   

426
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:25,880
So let's say the 150 base pairs
that coded for insulin,

427
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,515
these make up a gene.

428
00:21:27,515 --> 00:21:30,600
   

429
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:36,450
And these 4,500 base pairs
make up another gene.

430
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:40,070
Now, all of the genes don't make
proteins, but all of the

431
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,720
proteins are made by genes.

432
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:45,940
So let's say I have just a
bunch of-- I'll just make

433
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:51,770
another A, G, and it goes down,
down, down, and you have

434
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:54,920
a T and then a C and a
C, and let's say I

435
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,840
have 4,500 of these.

436
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,480
These could code
for a protein.

437
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,320
These could code for protein,
or they could have all of

438
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:07,480
these other kind of regulatory
functions telling what other

439
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,400
parts of the DNA should and
should not be coded and how

440
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,870
the DNA behaves, so it becomes
super, super complex.

441
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:18,050
But this kind of section of our
DNA, this is what we refer

442
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:24,400
to as a gene, and a gene can
have anywhere from a couple of

443
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,990
hundreds of these base pairs
or these bases to several

444
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:30,860
thousand of these base pairs.

445
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:34,220
Now, a gene is that part of our
chromosome that codes for

446
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:37,920
a particular protein or serves
a certain function.

447
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,285
Now, there are different
versions of genes.

448
00:22:40,285 --> 00:22:43,000
   

449
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,580
It's a gross oversimplification,
but let me

450
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:49,815
say this is the gene
for insulin.

451
00:22:49,815 --> 00:22:53,040
   

452
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,650
Now, there might be slight
variations in how insulin can

453
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:59,880
be coded for, and I'm kind of
going out of my domain right

454
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,870
here, because I don't
know if that's true.

455
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:02,580
And maybe I shouldn't just
speak specifically about

456
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,860
insulin, but it's coding for
some protein, but there's

457
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,990
maybe multiple different
ways that that

458
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:08,470
protein can be coded.

459
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:11,540
Maybe instead of a T here,
sometimes there's a C there.

460
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,000
It still codes for
the same protein.

461
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,330
It doesn't change it quite
enough, but that protein acts

462
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:18,730
just a little bit different.

463
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,420
It's a slight variant.

464
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,750
I'll use that word.

465
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:24,850
Now, each variant of this gene
is called an allele.

466
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:27,540
   

467
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:34,845
It's a specific variant
of your gene.

468
00:23:34,845 --> 00:23:37,460
   

469
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:45,230
Now, if you take this DNA chain,
and this chain over

470
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:45,840
here-- let's see.

471
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,910
This is one base pair.

472
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:50,000
This might be like one base.

473
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,200
This is another base.

474
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,430
Maybe this is an adenine and
then this would be a thymine

475
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:55,900
over here in green.

476
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:59,220
This is an adenine and this
would be a thymine.

477
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:02,570
If right here this is a guanine,
then right here would

478
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:03,710
be a cytosine.

479
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,610
This would be just a
very small section.

480
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:10,800
If I were to like zoom out, and
let's say we have a big

481
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:14,180
chain of DNA where each of these
little dots are a base

482
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:19,510
pair that I'm drawing here,
maybe this section

483
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:23,310
codes for gene 1.

484
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:25,630
And then there's some noise or
things that we haven't fully

485
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,120
understood yet.

486
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:26,940
Now, I want to be clear.

487
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,790
Just with a simple discussion of
DNA, we're already kind of

488
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:32,110
approaching the frontiers of
what we know and what we don't

489
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:35,890
know, because DNA is hugely
complex, and there's all of

490
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:38,300
these feedback structures, and
certain genes tell you to code

491
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,600
for other genes and not to code
for other genes and to

492
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,250
code under certain
circumstances, hugely complex.

493
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:45,050
So there's huge sections of
DNA that we still don't

494
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,990
understand what exactly
they do.

495
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:48,930
But then maybe they'll have
another section here that

496
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:50,470
codes for gene 2.

497
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:52,570
Maybe gene 2 is a little
bit longer.

498
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:54,510
Maybe it's 1,000 base pairs.

499
00:24:54,510 --> 00:25:00,380
But when you take all of these
and you turn it into a-- it

500
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:04,990
kind of winds in on
itself like this.

501
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:05,610
Let me do it.

502
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:08,980
So it'll wind up, winding in on
itself like this and do all

503
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,440
sorts of crazy things.

504
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,880
Remember, it completely bundles
itself up, and then it

505
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,300
looks something like that.

506
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,800
Then you get a chromosome.

507
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,550
   

508
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:24,620
And just to get an idea of how
large a chromosome is compared

509
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:29,090
to the actual base pairs,
chromosome number one in the

510
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:31,600
human genome-- so we
have 23 pairs.

511
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,140
If you look at it inside of a
nucleus-- so let's say that's

512
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:34,620
the nucleus.

513
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,720
Let's say this is the cell.

514
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,960
The cell is much bigger
than what I'm showing.

515
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,925
But we have 23 pairs
of chromosomes.

516
00:25:39,925 --> 00:25:44,020
   

517
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,620
I won't do all of them.

518
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,280
You can actually see
chromosomes in a

519
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:50,290
not-too-expensive microscope, so
we're already getting to a

520
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:51,580
scale that we can start
to look at.

521
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:55,200
But the largest chromosome,
which is chromosome number one

522
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,370
in the human genome, just to
give an idea of how much

523
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:02,760
information it's packing, that
thing right there has 220

524
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:06,640
million base pairs.

525
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,960
Sometimes people talk about
chromosomes and genetics and

526
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,070
genes and base pairs
interchangeably, but it's very

527
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,730
important to kind of get
an idea of scale.

528
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:15,910
These chromosomes are a
super-long strand of DNA

529
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:18,850
that's all configured and
bundled up, and it contains

530
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:21,060
220 million base pairs.

531
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:23,920
So the actual elements that are
coding for the information

532
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:27,530
are unbelievably small
relative to

533
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:29,150
the chromosome itself.

534
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:31,260
But now that we understand a
little bit, and actually I

535
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:34,490
want to take a look back at
this, because this kind of

536
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:36,960
blows my mind, that if you
just take those little

537
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,370
combinations of those amino
acids, you can form these very

538
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:42,890
intricate, very advanced
structures that we're still

539
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:46,500
fully understanding how they
actually interact with each

540
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:51,155
other and regulate how all of
our biological processes work.

541
00:26:51,155 --> 00:26:54,850
And what's even more amazing is
that this scheme that I've

542
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:58,340
talked about in this video about
DNA to mRNA to tRNA to

543
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:02,580
these molecules, this is true
for all of life on our planet,

544
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,580
so we all share this
same mechanism.

545
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:09,930
Me and this plant, we share
that common root

546
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:11,340
that we all have DNA.

547
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:14,580
As different as me and that
roach that I might not like to

548
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:18,240
be in the same room, we all
share that same common root of

549
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,880
DNA and that all of it codes to
proteins in this exact same

550
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,440
way, that there's this
commonality amongst all life.

551
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,700
That, to me, is mind blowing.

552
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:28,970
Then even more mind blowing is
how these very complex shapes

553
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:31,360
are formed by the DNA.

554
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,860
And this isn't speculation.

555
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,710
This is observed behavior.

556
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,800
This is a fascinating structure
right here, but it's

557
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:43,060
just based on 20 amino acid--
you can almost view the amino

558
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:46,500
acid as the LEGOS, and you put
the LEGOS together, and just

559
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:51,890
the chemical interactions form
these fairly impressive

560
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:53,090
structures right here.

561
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:55,460
So now that we know a little bit
about DNA and how it codes

562
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:58,400
into protein, we can take a
little jump back and talk a

563
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,480
little bit more about how
variation is actually

564
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,210
introduced into a population.

565
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:04,867
