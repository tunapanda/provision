1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,750
   

2
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,030
I've talked a lot about the
importance of hemoglobin in

3
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:06,130
our red blood cells so I thought
I would dedicate an

4
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:08,340
entire video to hemoglobin.

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,210
One-- because it's important,
but also it explains a lot

6
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:15,410
about how the hemoglobin-- or
the red blood cells, depending

7
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:18,110
on what level you want to
operate-- know, and I have to

8
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:19,050
use know in quotes.

9
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,890
These aren't sentient beings,
but how do they know when to

10
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,060
pick up the oxygen and when
to drop off the oxygen?

11
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,790
So this right here, this is
actually a picture of a

12
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:31,710
hemoglobin protein.

13
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,240
   

14
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,790
It's made up of four
amino acid chains.

15
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,430
That's one of them.

16
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:41,770
Those are the other two.

17
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:44,010
We're not going to go into the
detail of that, but these look

18
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,200
like little curly ribbons.

19
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,300
If you imagine them, they're a
bunch of molecules and amino

20
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,220
acids and then they're curled
around like that.

21
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:52,590
So this on some level
describes its shape.

22
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:57,140
And in each of those groups or
in each of those chains, you

23
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:03,110
have a heme group
here in green.

24
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,420
That's where you get the
hem in hemoglobin from.

25
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,870
You have four heme groups and
the globins are essentially

26
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:11,150
describing the rest of it-- the
protein structures, the

27
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,310
four peptide chains

28
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:15,100
Now, this heme group-- this
is pretty interesting.

29
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,860
It actually is a porphyrin
structure.

30
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,790
And if you watch the video on
chlorophyll, you'd remember a

31
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,890
porphyrin structure, but at
the very center of it, in

32
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:26,670
chlorophyll, we had a magnesium
ion, but at the very

33
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:34,440
center of hemoglobin, we have an
iron ion and this is where

34
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,720
the oxygen binds.

35
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,810
So on this hemoglobin, you have
four major binding sites

36
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:39,370
for oxygen.

37
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,540
You have right there, maybe
right there, a little bit

38
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:45,660
behind, right there,
and right there.

39
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:51,510
Now why is hemoglobin-- oxygen
will bind very well here, but

40
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:54,440
hemoglobin has a several
properties that one, make it

41
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,720
really good at binding oxygen
and then also really good at

42
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,240
dumping oxygen when it
needs to dump oxygen.

43
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,905
So it exhibits something called
cooperative binding.

44
00:02:04,905 --> 00:02:09,990
   

45
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:14,270
And this is just the principle
that once it binds to one

46
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:18,450
oxygen molecule-- let's say
one oxygen molecule binds

47
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:22,710
right there-- it changes the
shape in such a way that the

48
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:26,750
other sites are more likely
to bind oxygen.

49
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:32,450
So it just makes it-- one
binding makes the other

50
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,700
bindings more likely.

51
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:42,820
   

52
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,300
Now you say, OK, that's fine.

53
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:48,130
That makes it a very good oxygen
acceptor, when it's

54
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:52,160
traveling through the pulmonary
capillaries and

55
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,310
oxygen is diffusing
from the alveoli.

56
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:57,590
That makes it really good at
picking up the oxygen, but how

57
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:00,420
does it know when to
dump the oxygen?

58
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,680
This is an interesting
question.

59
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,230
   

60
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:10,050
It doesn't have eyes or some
type of GPS system that says,

61
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:14,050
this guy's running right now and
so he's generating a lot

62
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:17,710
of carbon dioxide right now in
these capillaries and he needs

63
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:20,290
a lot of oxygen in these
capillaries surrounding his

64
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:21,280
quadriceps.

65
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,095
I need to deliver oxygen.

66
00:03:22,095 --> 00:03:23,840
It doesn't know it's
in the quadraceps.

67
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,470
How does the hemoglobin know to
let go of the oxygen there?

68
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:32,510
And that's a byproduct of what
we call allosteric inhibition,

69
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:35,100
which is a very fancy word,
but the concept's actually

70
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,350
pretty straightforward.

71
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:40,850
   

72
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:44,880
When you talk about allosteric
anything-- it's often using

73
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,170
the context of enzymes-- you're
talking about the idea

74
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,460
that things bind
to other parts.

75
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,550
Allo means other.

76
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:55,260
So you're binding to other parts
of the protein or the

77
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:59,660
enzyme-- and enzymes are just
proteins-- and it affects the

78
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:02,310
ability of the protein
or the enzyme to do

79
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,750
what it normally does.

80
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,430
So hemoglobin is allosterically
inhibited by

81
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:13,500
carbon dioxide and by protons.

82
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,230
So carbon dioxide can bond
to other parts of the

83
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,540
hemoglobin-- I don't
know the exact

84
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,490
spots-- and so can protons.

85
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,640
So remember, acidity
just means a high

86
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,930
concentration of protons.

87
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,760
So if you're in an acidic
environment, protons can bond.

88
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,470
Maybe I'll do the protons
in this pink color.

89
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:31,970
Protons-- which are just
hydrogen without electrons,

90
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:36,200
right-- protons can bond to
certain parts of our protein

91
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,370
and it makes it harder for them
to hold onto the oxygen.

92
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:42,730
So when you're in the presence
of a lot of carbon dioxide or

93
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:46,740
an acidic environment, this
thing is going to let go of

94
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:47,730
its oxygen.

95
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:50,650
And it just happens to be that
that's a really good time to

96
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:51,680
let go of your oxygen.

97
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,340
Let's go back to this
guy running.

98
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,900
There's a lot of activity in
these cells right here in his

99
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,460
quadriceps.

100
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:03,420
They're releasing a lot of
carbon dioxide into the

101
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,310
capillaries.

102
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:09,390
At that point, they're going
from arteries into veins and

103
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,930
they need a lot of oxygen, which
is a great time for the

104
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,900
hemoglobin to dump
their oxygen.

105
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,560
So it's really good that
hemoglobin is allosterically

106
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,780
inhibited by carbon dioxide.

107
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,490
Carbon dioxide joins on
certain parts of it.

108
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,720
It starts letting go of its
oxygen, that's exactly where

109
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,700
in the body the oxygen
is needed.

110
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,360
Now you're saying, wait.

111
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,030
What about this acidic
environment?

112
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,350
How does this come into play?

113
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,990
Well, it turns out that most
of the carbon dioxide is

114
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,260
actually disassociated.

115
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,440
It actually disassociates.

116
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,970
It does go into the plasma, but
it actually gets turned

117
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:40,410
into carbonic acid.

118
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:43,590
So I'll just write a little
formula right here.

119
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:49,870
So if you have some CO2 and you
mix it with the water-- I

120
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:53,070
mean, most of our blood, the
plasma-- it's water.

121
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,880
So you take some carbon dioxide,
you mix it with

122
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,960
water, and you have it in the
presence of an enzyme-- and

123
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,155
this enzyme exists in
red blood cells.

124
00:06:02,155 --> 00:06:03,940
It's called carbonic
anhydrase.

125
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:10,890
   

126
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:14,310
A reaction will occur--
essentially you'll end up with

127
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,590
carbonic acid.

128
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:17,840
We have H2CO3.

129
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,630
   

130
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,260
It's all balanced.

131
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:24,670
We have three oxygens, two
hydrogens, one carbon.

132
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:27,700
It's called carbonic acid
because it gives away hydrogen

133
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,750
protons very easily.

134
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:34,020
Acids disassociate into their
conjugate base and hydrogen

135
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,200
protons very easily.

136
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:41,200
So carbonic acid disassociates
very easily.

137
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,340
It's an acid, although I'll
write in some type of an

138
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,910
equilibrium right there.

139
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:47,500
If any of this notation really
confuses you or you want more

140
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,680
detail on it, watch some of the
chemistry videos on acid

141
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,180
disassociation and equilibrium
reactions and all of that, but

142
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,540
it essentially can give away
one of these hydrogens, but

143
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,940
just the proton and it keeps the
electron of that hydrogen

144
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:03,210
so you're left with a hydrogen
proton plus-- well, you gave

145
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:05,700
away one of the hydrogens so
you just have one hydrogen.

146
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,680
This is actually a
bicarbonate ion.

147
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,470
   

148
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:13,760
But it only gave away the
proton, kept the electron so

149
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,130
you have a minus sign.

150
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:18,900
So all of the charge adds up to
neutral and that's neutral

151
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:19,700
over there.

152
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:23,930
So if I'm in a capillary
of the leg-- let me see

153
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,640
if I can draw this.

154
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,890
So let's say I'm in the
capillary of my leg.

155
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:30,650
Let me do a neutral color.

156
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,410
So this is a capillary
of my leg.

157
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,420
I've zoomed in just one
part of the capillary.

158
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,080
It's always branching off.

159
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:41,490
And over here, I have a bunch
of muscle cells right here

160
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:47,000
that are generating a lot
of carbon dioxide

161
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,580
and they need oxygen.

162
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,440
Well, what's going to happen?

163
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,340
Well, I have my red blood
cells flowing along.

164
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:57,750
It's actually interesting--
red blood cells-- their

165
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:01,280
diameter's 25% larger than
the smallest capillaries.

166
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,370
So essentially they get squeezed
as they go through

167
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:06,550
the small capillaries, which a
lot of people believe helps

168
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:10,810
them release their contents and
maybe some of the oxygen

169
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:11,870
that they have in them.

170
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:14,010
So you have a red blood cell
that's coming in here.

171
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:18,180
It's being squeezed through
this capillary right here.

172
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:22,130
It has a bunch of hemoglobin--
and when I say a bunch, you

173
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:25,800
might as well know right now,
each red blood cell has 270

174
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,240
million hemoglobin proteins.

175
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,169
And if you total up the
hemoglobin in the entire body,

176
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:38,080
it's huge because
we have 20 to 30

177
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,670
trillion red blood cells.

178
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:45,180
   

179
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:49,820
And each of those 20 to 30
trillion red blood cells have

180
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:55,330
270 million hemoglobin
proteins in them.

181
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,880
So we have a lot
of hemoglobin.

182
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,410
So anyway, that was a little
bit of a-- so actually, red

183
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:02,240
blood cells make up roughly
25% of all of the

184
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,080
cells in our body.

185
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,730
We have about 100 trillion
or a little bit

186
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:05,920
more, give or take.

187
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,910
I've never sat down
and counted them.

188
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:11,980
But anyway, we have 270 million
hemoglobin particles

189
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,950
or proteins in each red blood
cell-- explains why the red

190
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:18,100
blood cells had to shed their
nucleuses to make space for

191
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,370
all those hemoglobins.

192
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:21,510
They're carrying oxygen.

193
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:24,730
So right here we're dealing
with-- this

194
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,410
is an artery, right?

195
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:27,610
It's coming from the heart.

196
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,870
The red blood cell is going in
that direction and then it's

197
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:32,100
going to shed its oxygen
and then it's

198
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,080
going to become a vein.

199
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,640
Now what's going to happen is
you have this carbon dioxide.

200
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,390
You have a high concentration
of carbon dioxide in the

201
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:41,880
muscle cell.

202
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,530
It eventually, just by diffusion
gradient, ends up--

203
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:52,770
let me do that same color-- ends
up in the blood plasma

204
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:55,760
just like that and some of it
can make its way across the

205
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,220
membrane into the actual
red blood cell.

206
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:03,680
In the red blood cell, you have
this carbonic anhydrase

207
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,770
which makes the carbon dioxide
disassociate into-- or

208
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:09,900
essentially become carbonic
acid, which

209
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,370
then can release protons.

210
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:14,700
   

211
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,700
Well, those protons, we just
learned, can allosterically

212
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:22,250
inhibit the uptake of oxygen
by hemoglobin.

213
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,040
So those protons start bonding
to different parts and even

214
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,650
the carbon dioxide that hasn't
been reacted with-- that can

215
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:30,840
also allosterically inhibit
the hemoglobin.

216
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,630
So it also bonds
to other parts.

217
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:36,730
And that changes the shape of
the hemoglobin protein just

218
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:39,370
enough that it can't hold onto
its oxygens that well and it

219
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:40,640
starts letting go.

220
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,230
And just as we said we had
cooperative binding, the more

221
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:46,180
oxygens you have on, the better
it is at accepting

222
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,480
more-- the opposite happens.

223
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,720
When you start letting go of
oxygen, it becomes harder to

224
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,540
retain the other ones.

225
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,260
So then all of the
oxygens let go.

226
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:55,410
So this, at least in my mind,
it's a brilliant, brilliant

227
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:58,910
mechanism because the oxygen
gets let go just where it

228
00:10:58,910 --> 00:10:59,735
needs to let go.

229
00:10:59,735 --> 00:11:05,760
It doesn't just say, I've
left an artery and

230
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,980
I'm now in a vein.

231
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,050
Maybe I've gone through some
capillaries right here and I'm

232
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:10,080
going to go back to a vein.

233
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,920
Let me release my oxygen--
because then it would just

234
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,180
release the oxygen willy-nilly
throughout the body.

235
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:17,110
This system, by being
allosterically inhibited by

236
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:20,570
carbon dioxide and an acidic
environment, it allows it to

237
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:23,730
release it where it is most
needed, where there's the most

238
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:28,570
carbon dioxide, where
respiration is occurring most

239
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:29,870
vigorously.

240
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:32,550
So it's a fascinating,
fascinating scheme.

241
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,540
And just to get a better
understanding of it, right

242
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:37,520
here I have this little chart
right here that shows the

243
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,740
oxygen uptake by hemoglobin or
how saturated it can be.

244
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,560
And you might see this in maybe
your biology class so

245
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,590
it's a good thing
to understand.

246
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:48,890
So right here, we have on the
x-axis or the horizontal axis,

247
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:51,450
we have the partial pressure
of oxygen.

248
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:54,180
And if you watched the chemistry
lectures on partial

249
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,350
pressure, you know that partial
pressure just means,

250
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,990
how frequently are you being
bumped into by oxygen?

251
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:03,480
Pressure is generated by gases
or molecules bumping into you.

252
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,300
It doesn't have to be gas,
but just molecules

253
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,310
bumping into you.

254
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:09,390
And then the partial pressure
of oxygen is the amount of

255
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:11,310
that that's generated
by oxygen molecules

256
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:11,990
bumping into you.

257
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:14,370
So you can imagine as you go
to the right, there's just

258
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:17,160
more and more oxygen around so
you're going to get more and

259
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,930
more bumped into by oxygen.

260
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:21,510
So this is just essentially
saying, how much oxygen is

261
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,590
around as you go to
the right axis?

262
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:27,550
And then the vertical axis tells
you, how saturated are

263
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,150
your hemoglobin molecules?

264
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:33,610
This 100% would mean all of the
heme groups on all of the

265
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:37,980
hemoglobin molecules or proteins
have bound to oxygen.

266
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:41,280
Zero means that none have. So
when you have an environment

267
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,630
with very little oxygen-- and
this actually shows the

268
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:48,060
cooperative binding-- so let's
say we're just dealing with an

269
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,960
environment with very
little oxygen.

270
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:53,410
So once a little bit of oxygen
binds, then it makes it even

271
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:56,200
more likely that more and
more oxygen will bind.

272
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,840
As soon as a little-- that's why
the slope is increasing.

273
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,220
I don't want to go into algebra
and calculus here, but

274
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,900
as you see, we're kind
of flattish, and

275
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,550
then the slope increases.

276
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,990
So as we bind to some oxygen,
it makes it more likely that

277
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:07,605
we'll bind to more.

278
00:13:07,605 --> 00:13:12,420
And at some point, it's hard for
oxygens to bump just right

279
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,730
into the right hemoglobin
molecules, but you can see

280
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:17,040
that it kind of accelerates
right around here.

281
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,620
Now, if we have an acidic
environment that has a lot of

282
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:24,350
carbon dioxide so that the
hemoglobin is allosterically

283
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:27,190
inhibited, it's not going
to be as good at this.

284
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:31,830
So in an acidic environment,
this curve for any level of

285
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:34,620
oxygen partial pressure or any
amount of oxygen, we're going

286
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,990
to have less bound hemoglobin.

287
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:39,140
Let me do that in a
different color.

288
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,110
So then the curve would
look like this.

289
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:46,930
The saturation curve will
look like this.

290
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:51,200
   

291
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,360
So this is an acidic
environment.

292
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,410
Maybe there's some carbon
dioxide right here.

293
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:06,300
So the hemoglobin is being
allosterically inhibited so

294
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,820
it's more likely to dump the
oxygen at this point.

295
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,300
So I don't know.

296
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,250
I don't know how exciting you
found that, but I find it

297
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:15,450
brilliant because it really is
the simplest way for these

298
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:17,480
things to dump their oxygen
where needed.

299
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:22,080
No GPS needed, no robots needed
to say, I'm now in the

300
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,610
quadriceps and the
guy is running.

301
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:24,415
Let me dump my oxygen.

302
00:14:24,415 --> 00:14:26,410
It just does it naturally
because it's a more acidic

303
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:28,180
environment with more
carbon dioxide.

304
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:31,120
It gets inhibited and then the
oxygen gets dumped and ready

305
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,070
to use for respiration.

306
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:33,472
