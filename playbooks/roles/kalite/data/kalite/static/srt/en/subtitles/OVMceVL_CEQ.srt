1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,380
   

2
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,550
We're asked to add 4/9 and 11/12
and to write our answer

3
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:07,310
as a mixed number, and then
simplify and write our answer

4
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:09,240
as a mixed number.

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,970
So here we have two fractions
we're adding together, but we

6
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,700
have different denominators.

7
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,800
So whenever you add fractions,
the first thing you have to do

8
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,880
is check the denominators.

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,840
If they're the same, you can
add, but if they're different

10
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,600
like this, you have to make
them have the same

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,580
denominator.

12
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:27,860
So what we have to do is find
a number that both 9 and 12

13
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,890
will divide into, and that
will be our common

14
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:33,800
denominator, and you'll see
why both 9 and 12 have to

15
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,970
divide into it.

16
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:37,070
So let's think about what that
number is, and there's two

17
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,790
ways of coming up with that
what we could call a least

18
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:44,300
common multiple, the smallest
multiple of both 9

19
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,540
and 12 that is common.

20
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,310
One way is just to kind of look
at the multiples of 9 and

21
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,450
see if any of them are
divisible by 12.

22
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:54,800
So if you start with 9--
we can do it over here.

23
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,230
So you have 9, that's
not divisible by 12.

24
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:59,810
18 isn't divisible by 12.

25
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,810
27 isn't divisible by 12.

26
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,670
36, well, that is
divisible by 12.

27
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,480
That is 12 times 3.

28
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,560
So 9 goes into 36 and
12 goes into 36.

29
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,620
So what we want to do is write
a common denominator.

30
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:17,870
So we're going to write 4/9 as
something over 36, and we're

31
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:23,500
going to write 11/12 as
something over 36.

32
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,370
Now, to turn your 9 into
a 36, you have to

33
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:32,720
multiply it by 4, right?

34
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,620
9 times 4 is equal to 36.

35
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:40,240
Now, you can't just multiply
the denominator by 4.

36
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,560
You also have to multiply the
numerator by the same thing.

37
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,600
So if you multiply the numerator
by 4, you get 4

38
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,090
times 4 is 16.

39
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,460
So 4/9 is the exact same
thing as 16/36.

40
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:55,550
If you wanted to simplify this
one to 4/9, you divide the

41
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:58,020
numerator and the denominator
by 4.

42
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,010
Now, we do the same
thing over here.

43
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:07,800
36, 12 times 3, so we're
multiplying 12 by 3 to get 36.

44
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,030
Well, if we did that to the
denominator, we also have to

45
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:14,180
do that to the numerator,
so 11 times 3 is 33.

46
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,660
And just like that, we've now
rewritten each of the

47
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,660
fractions so that they have
the same denominator.

48
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:22,570
Both of their denominators
is 36.

49
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:23,940
So now we're ready to add.

50
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:29,170
If you add these two things,
we'll have 36, because we're

51
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:33,110
considering kind of parts of
36 or fractions of 36, and

52
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,470
then we have 16 plus 33
in the numerator.

53
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,420
Let me write that down.

54
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:41,190
16 plus 33 in the numerator.

55
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:44,620
And 16 plus 33 is what?

56
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,020
6 plus 33 would be 39
and then you have

57
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,770
another 10, so it's 49.

58
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:57,390
So it's equal to 49/36.

59
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,360
Now, can we simplify this?

60
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,650
49, it's 7 squared, so it has
1, 7 and 49 as factors.

61
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,000
This has 1-- it has a bunch
of numbers, but it's not

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,770
divisible by 7, so this is
actually in simplest form, but

63
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:14,400
this is an improper fraction.

64
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,260
The numerator is larger
than the denominator.

65
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,480
So let's write it as
a proper fraction.

66
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:24,680
To do that, we divide
36 into 49.

67
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,850
36 goes into 49 how
many times?

68
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,440
Well, it only goes one
time, so it equals 1.

69
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,110
And how much will
be left over?

70
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:36,130
If I divide 36 into 49 one time,
or 1 times 36 is 36,

71
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:38,750
then I have 13 left
over to get to 49.

72
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:43,460
So it's 1 and 13/36.

73
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:46,100
And you can do that manually,
if you like you.

74
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,960
You'd say 36 into 49.

75
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,680
36 goes into 49 one time.

76
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,130
1 times 36 is 36, and
then you subtract.

77
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,770
9 minus 6 is 3.

78
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:58,310
4 minus 3 is 1.

79
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,740
You have a remainder of 13.

80
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,090
So that's our answer:
1 and 13/36.

81
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,334
