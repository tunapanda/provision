1
00:00:08,412 --> 00:00:11,145
By 14,000 years ago,

2
00:00:11,145 --> 00:00:14,386
the Ice Age was winding down.

3
00:00:16,555 --> 00:00:21,811
As the ice melted, oceans rose, and coastlines changed,

4
00:00:23,946 --> 00:00:28,462
some environmental barriers between populations vanished.

5
00:00:29,743 --> 00:00:32,714
While elsewhere, new ones appeared.

6
00:00:34,683 --> 00:00:38,719
Temperatures and rainfall increased dramatically.

7
00:00:40,911 --> 00:00:45,754
And some areas became so rich in plants and animals,

8
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:49,786
that people no longer had to travel in search of food.

9
00:00:51,492 --> 00:00:57,865
Instead, people settled into more permanent villages based on foraging.

10
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:05,522
By planting the seeds from wild grains near their homes,

11
00:01:05,522 --> 00:01:07,612
they could supplement their food supplies,

12
00:01:07,612 --> 00:01:11,112
and stay in the same spot year round.

13
00:01:13,558 --> 00:01:16,037
Perhaps as they became more sedentary,

14
00:01:16,037 --> 00:01:18,269
they had more opportunities for other,

15
00:01:18,269 --> 00:01:20,164
ahem, pursuits.

16
00:01:22,902 --> 00:01:25,717
In any case, populations grew

17
00:01:25,717 --> 00:01:30,537
and pretty soon, growing families in these villages became less suited

18
00:01:30,537 --> 00:01:33,015
to the nomadic lifestyle.

19
00:01:35,492 --> 00:01:39,090
In some places, during droughts or harsh winters,

20
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:44,008
local wild plants and animals could no longer support everyone.

21
00:01:47,552 --> 00:01:50,302
Independently and all over the world,

22
00:01:50,302 --> 00:01:53,994
people began making the same discovery,

23
00:01:53,994 --> 00:01:58,998
which would change human societies and the natural environment forever.

24
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:01,854
They developed

25
00:02:01,854 --> 00:02:03,831
AGRICULTURE!

26
00:02:05,308 --> 00:02:07,119
It's not an obvious choice,

27
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,744
hunter-gatherers can provide

28
00:02:09,744 --> 00:02:14,277
food for their families, by working only a few days a week.

29
00:02:15,785 --> 00:02:17,981
Farming, on the other hand,

30
00:02:17,981 --> 00:02:19,477
is hard work,

31
00:02:19,477 --> 00:02:21,578
and a full-time job.

32
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:30,231
But farming provided more food to feed larger populations consistently

33
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:38,347
Villages began relying more and more on their gardens.

34
00:02:39,716 --> 00:02:43,130
As mutant varieties of wild grains occured,

35
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,194
these early agriculturists

36
00:02:45,194 --> 00:02:48,094
chose the crops with larger seeds

37
00:02:48,094 --> 00:02:52,020
and grain ears that were easier to gather.

38
00:02:54,066 --> 00:02:58,763
People also domesticated docile, local animals.

39
00:03:02,161 --> 00:03:06,943
Villages grew, especially in areas with fertile soil,

40
00:03:07,644 --> 00:03:09,627
and became cities.

41
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:14,144
And settled people became

42
00:03:14,144 --> 00:03:17,547
more detached from the natural world.

43
00:03:20,178 --> 00:03:22,288
By 6,000 years ago,

44
00:03:22,288 --> 00:03:25,226
in Mesopotamia, there were cities

45
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:29,634
with wealth, power, and a new social order.

46
00:03:30,676 --> 00:03:35,281
Whoever controlled grain supplies wielded power.

47
00:03:36,402 --> 00:03:38,591
And some people no longer had to find

48
00:03:38,591 --> 00:03:40,694
or produce their own food,

49
00:03:40,694 --> 00:03:44,252
but rather exchange their services for dinner.

50
00:03:47,467 --> 00:03:49,472
Agricultural societies

51
00:03:49,472 --> 00:03:54,342
soon became the dominant way of life for people throughout the world.

52
00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:03,027
World populations exploded,

53
00:04:03,027 --> 00:04:06,908
creating more laborers to produce more crops,

54
00:04:09,789 --> 00:04:11,959
to feed more mouths,

55
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:15,786
more land had to be cleared for farming.

56
00:04:17,755 --> 00:04:21,582
Sometimes, whole towns relocated

57
00:04:21,582 --> 00:04:26,032
when soils couldn't sustain repeated cultivation.

58
00:04:29,647 --> 00:04:32,925
And each year, people took their livestock

59
00:04:32,925 --> 00:04:35,455
farther and farther afield to graze.

60
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:43,480
Groups who had been separated for thousands of years came in contact

61
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:48,495
as they traveled in search of land, labor, and trade goods.

62
00:04:51,445 --> 00:04:56,592
New means of transportation brought distant cultures in contact.

63
00:04:58,034 --> 00:05:03,452
New families produced from these contacts blurred genetic distinctions

64
00:05:03,452 --> 00:05:05,243
within continents,

65
00:05:06,915 --> 00:05:09,357
and all around the world.

66
00:05:09,357 --> 00:05:13,691
Migrating farmers encountered hunter-gatherers.

67
00:05:15,003 --> 00:05:17,942
In sub-Saharan Africa, for example,

68
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:25,378
farmers spread east and south from present-day Cameroon around 5,000 years ago.

69
00:05:28,655 --> 00:05:31,807
Along the way, they met and absorbed

70
00:05:31,807 --> 00:05:37,411
many of the people whose ancestors had been living there for thousands of years.

71
00:05:40,104 --> 00:05:43,407
Some hunter-gatherers who lived next to farming communities

72
00:05:43,407 --> 00:05:45,606
took up farming themselves.

73
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,459
But others followed game to areas unsuited to agriculture.

74
00:05:56,044 --> 00:05:58,706
By 1,500 years ago,

75
00:05:58,706 --> 00:06:03,530
agriculture dominated most of sub-Saharan Africa.

76
00:06:06,638 --> 00:06:10,829
But the Calahari Desert, too harsh for farming,

77
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:14,021
remained a home of hunter-gatherers,

78
00:06:14,021 --> 00:06:16,893
who kept not only much of their lifestyle,

79
00:06:16,893 --> 00:06:20,326
but also their unique click languages.

80
00:06:22,772 --> 00:06:25,214
In most places throughout the world,

81
00:06:25,214 --> 00:06:29,029
however, agriculture triumphed.

82
00:06:31,429 --> 00:06:34,341
As the new farmers on each continent

83
00:06:34,341 --> 00:06:38,308
expanded and absorbed other hunter-gatherer groups.

84
00:06:38,308 --> 00:06:43,241
Genetic differences within continents began disappearing,

85
00:06:43,241 --> 00:06:49,209
setting the stage for the most recent chapter in our human story.
