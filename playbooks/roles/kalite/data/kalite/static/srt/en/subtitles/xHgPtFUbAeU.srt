1
00:00:00,882 --> 00:00:04,592
We saw in the last video that when you multiply or you divide

2
00:00:04,592 --> 00:00:07,187
numbers, or (I guess I should say when you multiply or

3
00:00:07,187 --> 00:00:12,569
divide measurements) your result can only have as many

4
00:00:12,569 --> 00:00:17,067
significant digits as the thing with the smallest significant

5
00:00:17,067 --> 00:00:20,333
digits you ended up multiplying and dividing.

6
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:28,789
So just as a quick example, if I have 2.00 times (I don't know)

7
00:00:28,789 --> 00:00:36,058
3.5 my answer over here can only have 2 significant digits

8
00:00:36,058 --> 00:00:41,559
This has 2 significant digits, this has 3. 2 times 3.5

9
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:47,311
is 7, and we can get to 1 zero to the right of the decimal.

10
00:00:47,311 --> 00:00:48,912
Because we can have 2 significant digits.

11
00:00:48,912 --> 00:00:50,328
This was 3, this is 2.

12
00:00:50,328 --> 00:00:53,575
We only limited it to 2, because that was the smallest

13
00:00:53,575 --> 00:00:55,605
number of significant digits we had in all of the things

14
00:00:55,605 --> 00:00:57,712
that we were taking the product of.

15
00:00:57,712 --> 00:01:00,152
When we do addition and subtraction, it's a little bit different.

16
00:01:00,152 --> 00:01:01,627
And I'll do an example first.

17
00:01:01,627 --> 00:01:06,227
I just do a kind of a numerical example first, and then I'll think of a little bit more of a real world example.

18
00:01:06,227 --> 00:01:09,027
And obviously even my real world examples aren't really real world.

19
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:11,026
In my last video, I talked about laying down carpet

20
00:01:11,026 --> 00:01:13,776
and someone rightfully pointed out,"Hey, if you are laying down

21
00:01:13,776 --> 00:01:17,267
carpet, you always want to round up. Just because you don't wanna

22
00:01:17,267 --> 00:01:20,875
it's easier to cut carpet away, then somehow glue carpet there.

23
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:24,467
But that's particular to carpet. I was just saying a general way

24
00:01:24,467 --> 00:01:26,420
to think about precision in significant figures.

25
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,286
That was only particular to carpets or tiles.

26
00:01:29,286 --> 00:01:34,679
But when you add, when you add, or subtract,

27
00:01:34,679 --> 00:01:39,409
now these significant digits or these significant figures don't matter as much

28
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:42,867
as the actual precision of the things that you are adding.

29
00:01:42,867 --> 00:01:45,333
How many decimal places do you go? For example,

30
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:53,996
if I were to add 1.26, and I were to add it to - let's say - to 2.3.

31
00:01:53,996 --> 00:01:57,200
If you just add these two numbers up, and let's say these are measurements,

32
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,956
so when you make it (these are clearly 3

33
00:01:58,956 --> 00:02:02,886
significant digits) we're able to measure to the nearest hundreth.

34
00:02:02,919 --> 00:02:06,967
Here this is two significant digits so three significant digits

35
00:02:06,967 --> 00:02:10,303
this is two significant digits, we are able to measure to the nearest tenth.

36
00:02:10,303 --> 00:02:14,008
Let me label this. This is the hundredth

37
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:16,998
and this is the tenth. When you add or subtract numbers,

38
00:02:16,998 --> 00:02:20,229
your answer, so if you just do this, if we just add these

39
00:02:20,229 --> 00:02:24,499
two numbers, I get - what? - 3.56.

40
00:02:24,499 --> 00:02:30,799
The sum, or the difference whatever you take, you don't count significant figures

41
00:02:30,799 --> 00:02:33,099
You don't say,"Hey, this can only have two significant figures."

42
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:38,233
What you can say is, "This can only be as precise as the least precise thing that I had over here.

43
00:02:38,233 --> 00:02:40,965
The least precise thing I had over here is 2.3.

44
00:02:40,965 --> 00:02:44,129
It only went to the tenths place, so in our answer

45
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:49,233
we can only go to the tenths place. So we need to round

46
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:54,166
this guy up. Cause we have a six right here, so we round up

47
00:02:54,166 --> 00:03:00,383
so if you care about significant figures, this is going to become a 3.7.

48
00:03:00,383 --> 00:03:02,466
And I want to be clear. This time it worked out,

49
00:03:02,466 --> 00:03:04,048
cause this also has 2 significant figures,

50
00:03:04,048 --> 00:03:06,899
this also has two significant figures. But this could have been...

51
00:03:06,899 --> 00:03:12,129
(let me do another situation) you could have 1.26 plus

52
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:19,768
102.3, and you would get obviously 103.56.

53
00:03:19,768 --> 00:03:23,396
Then, in this situation - this obviously over here has 4 significant figures,

54
00:03:23,396 --> 00:03:26,768
this over here has 3 significant figures. But in our answer

55
00:03:26,768 --> 00:03:29,501
we don't want to have 3 significant figures. We wanna have the...

56
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:32,768
only as precise as the least precise thing that we added up.

57
00:03:32,768 --> 00:03:36,400
The least precise thing we only go one digit behind the decimal over here,

58
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,035
so we can only go to the tenth, only one digit over the decimal there.

59
00:03:40,035 --> 00:03:45,234
So once again, we round it up to 103.6.

60
00:03:45,234 --> 00:03:49,317
And to see why that makes sense, let's do a little bit of an example here

61
00:03:49,317 --> 00:03:50,769
with actually measuring something.

62
00:03:50,769 --> 00:03:52,628
So let's say we have a block here,

63
00:03:52,628 --> 00:03:56,896
let's say that I have a block, we draw that block a little bit neater,

64
00:03:56,896 --> 00:03:59,069
and let's say we have a pretty good meter stick,

65
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:01,501
and we're able to measure to the nearest centimeter,

66
00:04:01,501 --> 00:04:06,901
we get, it is 2.09 meters.

67
00:04:06,901 --> 00:04:14,368
Let's say we have another block, and this is the other block right over there.

68
00:04:14,368 --> 00:04:18,638
We have a, let's say we have an even more precise meter stick,

69
00:04:18,638 --> 00:04:20,501
which can measure to the nearest millimeter.

70
00:04:20,501 --> 00:04:26,319
And we get this to be 1.901 meters.

71
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:28,402
So measuring to the nearest millimeter.

72
00:04:28,402 --> 00:04:31,166
And let's say those measurements were done a long time ago,

73
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:33,237
and we don't have access to measure them any more,

74
00:04:33,237 --> 00:04:36,649
but someone says 'How tall is it if I were stack the blue block

75
00:04:36,649 --> 00:04:40,228
on the top of the red block - or the orange block, or whatever that color that is?"

76
00:04:40,228 --> 00:04:42,736
So how high would this height be?

77
00:04:42,736 --> 00:04:45,814
Well, if you didn't care about significant figures or precision,

78
00:04:45,814 --> 00:04:47,236
you would just add them up.

79
00:04:47,236 --> 00:04:52,982
You'd add the 1.901 plus the 2.09.

80
00:04:52,982 --> 00:04:54,168
So let me add those up:

81
00:04:54,168 --> 00:05:01,643
so if you take 1.901 and add that to 2.09,

82
00:05:01,643 --> 00:05:05,986
you get 1 plus nothing is 1,

83
00:05:05,986 --> 00:05:07,968
0 plus 9 is 9,

84
00:05:07,968 --> 00:05:09,501
9 plus 0 is 9,

85
00:05:09,501 --> 00:05:10,835
you get the decimal point,

86
00:05:10,835 --> 00:05:15,168
1 plus 2 is 3. So you get 3.991.

87
00:05:15,168 --> 00:05:19,508
And the problem with this, the reason why this is a little bit...

88
00:05:19,508 --> 00:05:21,832
it's kind of misrepresenting how precise you measurement is.

89
00:05:21,832 --> 00:05:26,811
You don't know, if I told you that the tower is 3.991 meters tall,

90
00:05:26,811 --> 00:05:29,768
I'm implying that I somehow was able to measure

91
00:05:29,768 --> 00:05:32,234
the entire tower to the nearest millimeter.

92
00:05:32,234 --> 00:05:34,442
The reality is that I was only be able to

93
00:05:34,442 --> 00:05:36,508
measure the part of the tower to the millimeter.

94
00:05:36,508 --> 00:05:39,835
This part of the tower I was able to measure to the nearest centimeter.

95
00:05:39,835 --> 00:05:43,101
So to make it clear the our measurement is only good

96
00:05:43,101 --> 00:05:44,307
to the nearest centimeter,

97
00:05:44,307 --> 00:05:46,067
because there is more error here, then...

98
00:05:46,067 --> 00:05:50,101
it might overwhelm or whatever the precision we had on the millimeters there.

99
00:05:50,101 --> 00:05:53,168
To make that clear, we have to make this only as precise

100
00:05:53,168 --> 00:05:55,708
as the least precise thing that we are adding up.

101
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:58,818
So over here, the least precise thing was, we went to the hundredths,

102
00:05:58,818 --> 00:06:01,501
so over here we have to round to the hundredths.

103
00:06:01,501 --> 00:06:04,832
So, since 1 is less then 5, we are going to round down,

104
00:06:04,832 --> 00:06:06,968
and so we can only legitimately say,

105
00:06:06,968 --> 00:06:08,646
if we want to represent what we did properly

106
00:06:08,646 --> 00:06:12,311
that the tower is 3.99 meters.

107
00:06:12,311 --> 00:06:16,174
And I also want to make it clear that this doesn't just apply

108
00:06:16,174 --> 00:06:17,811
to when there is a decimal point.

109
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:23,105
If I were tell you that... Let's say that I were to measure...

110
00:06:23,105 --> 00:06:25,239
I want to measure a building.

111
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:28,035
I was only able to measure the building to the nearest 10 feet.

112
00:06:28,035 --> 00:06:32,155
So I tell you that that building is 350 feet tall.

113
00:06:32,155 --> 00:06:34,615
So this is the building.

114
00:06:34,615 --> 00:06:37,830
This is a building.

115
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:42,708
And let's say there is a manufacturer of radio antennas, so...

116
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,366
or radio towers.

117
00:06:44,366 --> 00:06:49,378
And the manufacturers has measured their tower to the nearest foot.

118
00:06:49,378 --> 00:06:53,715
And they say, their tower is 8 feet tall.

119
00:06:53,715 --> 00:06:56,174
So notice: here they measure to the nearest 10 feet,

120
00:06:56,174 --> 00:06:58,100
here they measure to the nearest foot.

121
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,234
And actually to make it clear, because once again,

122
00:07:00,234 --> 00:07:01,900
as I said, this is ambiguous,

123
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,167
it's not 100% clear how many significant figures there are.

124
00:07:04,167 --> 00:07:09,241
Maybe it was exactly 350 feet or maybe they just rounded it to the nearest 10 feet.

125
00:07:09,241 --> 00:07:10,878
So a better way to represent this,

126
00:07:10,878 --> 00:07:14,234
they... would be to say instead of writing it 350,

127
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:21,234
a better way to write it would be 3.5 times 10 to the second feet tall.

128
00:07:21,234 --> 00:07:22,835
And when you are writing in scientific notation,

129
00:07:22,835 --> 00:07:26,635
that makes it very clear that there is only 2 significant digits here,

130
00:07:26,635 --> 00:07:28,635
you are only measuring to the nearest 10 feet.

131
00:07:28,635 --> 00:07:30,167
Other way to represent it:

132
00:07:30,167 --> 00:07:33,242
you could write 350 this notation has done less,

133
00:07:33,242 --> 00:07:36,768
but sometimes the last significant digit has a line on the top of it,

134
00:07:36,768 --> 00:07:39,635
or the last significant digit has a line below it.

135
00:07:39,635 --> 00:07:42,460
Either of those are ways to specify it,

136
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,968
this is probably the least ambiguous,

137
00:07:43,968 --> 00:07:47,794
but assuming that they only make measure to the nearest 10 feet,

138
00:07:47,794 --> 00:07:52,100
If someone were ask you: "How tall is the building plus the tower?"

139
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,301
Well, your first reaction were, let's just add

140
00:07:54,301 --> 00:07:58,213
the 350 plus 8, you get 358.

141
00:07:58,213 --> 00:08:04,715
You'd get 358 feet. So this is the building plus the tower. 358 feet.

142
00:08:04,715 --> 00:08:06,900
For once again, we are misrepresenting it.

143
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,794
We are making it look like we were able

144
00:08:08,794 --> 00:08:10,842
to measure the combination to the nearest foot.

145
00:08:10,842 --> 00:08:13,642
But we were able to measure only the tower to the nearest foot.

146
00:08:13,642 --> 00:08:19,568
So in order to represent our measurement at the level of precision at we really did,

147
00:08:19,568 --> 00:08:22,042
we really have to round this to the nearest 10 feet.

148
00:08:22,042 --> 00:08:24,635
Because that was our least precise measurement.

149
00:08:24,635 --> 00:08:26,840
So we would really have to round this up to,

150
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,234
8 is greater-than-or-equal to 5,

151
00:08:29,234 --> 00:08:33,710
so we round this up to 360 feet.

152
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,768
So once again, whatever is...

153
00:08:35,768 --> 00:08:39,044
Just to make it clear, even this ambiguous,

154
00:08:39,044 --> 00:08:42,301
maybe we put a line over to show, that is our level of precision,

155
00:08:42,301 --> 00:08:43,968
that we have 2 significant digits.

156
00:08:43,968 --> 00:08:49,301
Or we could write this as 3.6 times 10 to the second.

157
00:08:49,301 --> 00:08:50,301
Which is times 100.

158
00:08:50,301 --> 00:08:53,382
3.6 times 10 to the second feet in scientific notation.

159
00:08:53,382 --> 00:08:57,567
And this makes it very clear that we only have 2 significant digits here.
