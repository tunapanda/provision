1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,680
   

2
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:02,420
Let's keep doing some problems.

3
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:07,630
So in the last time I said,
what are the chances of not

4
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:12,480
getting any heads if I flip the
coin-- I was going to say dice,

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,890
but I realized we're
dealing with a coin.

6
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,580
If we flip the coin seven
times, if you said, well,

7
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,200
that's the same thing as
getting 7 tails in a

8
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,950
row, and that's 1/2
to the seventh power.

9
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:25,980
Because each trial there's a
1/2 chance of getting the exact

10
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,140
thing that we want, which
in this case is tails.

11
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,210
And you multiply it times
itself seven times

12
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,330
and you get 1/128.

13
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:36,790
It actually turns out that
there are actually 1/128

14
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:40,530
possible results that we can
get, equally probable results.

15
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:41,680
And why do I say that?

16
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,460
Well, what's the probability of
getting-- I don't know-- all

17
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,600
heads and then the last
flip I get is tails?

18
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,770
So heads, heads, heads,
heads-- so I'm doing it

19
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:55,540
seven times, rights?

20
00:00:55,540 --> 00:01:02,630
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and then
the last time I get a tails.

21
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:06,820
If you can think of it, this is
exactly 1 particular result out

22
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,140
of the total results
that we can get.

23
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,270
And what's the
probably of this?

24
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,600
Well, there's a 1/2 chance of
getting a heads, 1/2 chance of

25
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,760
a heads, 1/2 chance of heads--
let me switch colors-- 1/2

26
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,720
chance of a heads, 1/2 chance
of a heads, 1/2 chance of a

27
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,750
heads, and then 1/2
chance of a tails.

28
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,650
Once again, this is just 1/2
times 1/2 times 1/2 times

29
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:30,580
1/2 times 1/2 times 1/2,
which is equal to 1/128.

30
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:35,690
So any particular-- I don't
want to say combination because

31
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,910
we'll learn a little bit about
permutations and combinations

32
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:39,080
in future videos.

33
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:45,620
But any particular set of
circumstances we want is 1

34
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:50,110
out of 128 of the total
number of outcomes.

35
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:50,600
That what I should use.

36
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,280
Instead of circumstances,
outcomes.

37
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,490
If I have any particular
outcome-- so this is a

38
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:59,090
particular outcome, the way to
view it is there are 128

39
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:02,480
particular outcomes, so if I
choose one of them my odds of

40
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,060
getting it is 1 out of 128.

41
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,310
So let me ask you a question.

42
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:09,220
   

43
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:17,470
What's the probability of
getting exactly 1 heads?

44
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:22,650
   

45
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,230
So what does this mean?

46
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:29,790
This means I could get-- oh, I
could get tails, tails, tails

47
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,490
and-- let's say we're doing it
five times just so I don't

48
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,610
waste too much time.

49
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,655
Out of 5 rolls, out of 5 flips.

50
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:40,160
   

51
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,130
So that could be
tails, tails, heads.

52
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:47,290
That could be-- as you
can tell, I switched

53
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:48,460
colors arbitrarily.

54
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:54,320
That could be tails, tails,
tails, head, tails.

55
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,210
I think you get the pattern.

56
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:58,350
Tails, tails, heads,
tails, tails.

57
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:02,120
That could be tails, heads,
tails, tails, tails.

58
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,620
That could be tail-- oh sorry.

59
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,270
That could be heads,
tails, tails, tails.

60
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:12,160
So if we look at this way
there's this probability.

61
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,280
There's actually how many
events, how many outcomes,

62
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,730
would satisfy this
statement, exactly 1 heads?

63
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:21,320
Well, there's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

64
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,070
And the way you could think
of it is we're going to do

65
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,840
5 flips, exactly 1 of the
flips is going to be heads.

66
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,860
It could be any 1
of those 5 flips.

67
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,050
There are 5 situations
in which that happens.

68
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,860
And notice, I said
exactly one heads.

69
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,750
Because if I said at least 1
heads then we would have to

70
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:39,060
take into circumstances where
we have 2 heads and then it

71
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,070
becomes more complicated.

72
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:42,910
We'll learn more about that
when we do combinations.

73
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:47,720
So what are the chances of any
one of these possible outcomes?

74
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,890
Well, if we just
look at this one.

75
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:54,830
There's a chance of 1/2,
1/2, 1/2, 1/2, 1/2, so it's

76
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:57,610
1/2 to the fifth power.

77
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:00,960
Which is equal to 1/32.

78
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,770
And you use the same
logic each to these.

79
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:12,500
This is 1/32, 1/32,
1/32, 1 out of 32.

80
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,480
And in general, when I'm
flipping a fair coin five times

81
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,510
in a row there are going to
be 32 possible outcomes.

82
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,720
And each of these is just 1
of the particular outcome.

83
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,980
And we're essentially saying,
out of the 32 outcomes, 5

84
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:31,780
satisfy the event that we're
looking for-- exactly 1

85
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,690
heads out of 5 flips.

86
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:38,710
So there are 5 that satisfy it
out of a total of 32 outcomes.

87
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:41,060
And so using that definition
only if we can say that all

88
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,580
of the outcomes are
equally probable.

89
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:49,200
The probability is 5/32.

90
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,900
And then you could say, well,
let me make it a little

91
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,820
bit more complicated.

92
00:04:53,820 --> 00:05:07,180
What is the probability of not
getting exactly one head?

93
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,500
So here there is a lot more
circumstances that satisfy it.

94
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,410
So for example, let me
throw out a couple

95
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:14,285
that would satisfy it.

96
00:05:14,285 --> 00:05:15,090
Well, you could get all tails.

97
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:18,310
   

98
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:20,865
But also, if you got 2 heads
that would satisfy it because

99
00:05:20,865 --> 00:05:25,780
you didn't get exactly 1 head,
So this would also satisfy it.

100
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,300
And so you might say, well,
if we do it like this

101
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,320
it's really complicated.

102
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:36,440
Or you could say, well, these
5/32 are the only outcomes that

103
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,580
don't satisfy-- that do not
satisfy this condition.

104
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:43,590
So the rest of the what?

105
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:44,800
32 minus 5 is what?

106
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,660
27.

107
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,390
The other 27 outcomes
will satisfy this.

108
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,710
So you could say that this
is equal to-- and this is

109
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:53,760
a common trick in a lot
of probability problems.

110
00:05:53,760 --> 00:06:02,130
This is equal to 1 minus the
probability of getting exactly

111
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:04,325
one heads out of 5 flips.

112
00:06:04,325 --> 00:06:07,280
   

113
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,620
And that is equal to-- 1 is
the same thing as 32/32.

114
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,220
Minus-- what's the
probability of this?

115
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:14,960
We figured it out.

116
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,120
It's 5/32.

117
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,220
And that equals 27/32.

118
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,090
So that's just always
something to keep in mind.

119
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:26,820
Sometimes when you get a
probability problem it seems

120
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,970
difficult to solve that
problem, but it's actually

121
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:32,780
not that difficult to solve
the opposite problem.

122
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:36,060
So you say, well, it's hard for
me to directly figure out the

123
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,650
probability of not getting
exactly one heads; I'd have to

124
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,170
know combinations
and all of this.

125
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:44,430
But this is the opposite of
getting exactly one heads,

126
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,860
and that's an easier thing
for me to figure out.

127
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,230
So if I can figure out that
probability, all of the other

128
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,930
outcomes would satisfy
the opposite one.

129
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:53,830
Hope I didn't confuse you.

130
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,160
So anyway, everything we've
done so far, it's been dealing

131
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,530
with coins and fair coins and
that's interesting to a certain

132
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:03,660
degree, but let's make it so
that the different outcomes

133
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,380
have different probabilities.

134
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,680
Let's do free throw percentages
because I think this is

135
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:13,990
something that we all-- if we
watch basketball or play

136
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:16,220
any basketball, we're
familiar with the idea.

137
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:21,010
So let's say that I, and this
is not true, I only could

138
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:25,720
wish-- let's say that I have
an 80% free throw percentage.

139
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,940
So that means every time I go
to take a free throw there's an

140
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:37,260
80% chance there's a basket and
that there's a 20% chance

141
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,210
there's no basket.

142
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:40,390
How does this come up with?

143
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:42,780
Well, we'll do more on
statistics later and they're

144
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,730
really-- probability and
statistics are opposite

145
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,850
sides of the same I guess
coin, you could say.

146
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:51,690
But someone says OK, out of the
last hundred times Sal took

147
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:53,010
free throws he's made 80.

148
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:57,420
So in general, he has an 80%
chance of making a particular

149
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,720
free throw, but it might
not have been a hundred.

150
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,840
I might have taken a thousand
free throws and I made 800.

151
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,850
But that's where you come
up with the 80% from.

152
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:07,270
So that's fair enough.

153
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:12,745
So the 80% is p, and then
a common notation is

154
00:08:12,745 --> 00:08:16,080
the 20% is 1 minus p.

155
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,020
If I have an 80% chance of
making the shot, I have a 20%

156
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,990
chance of missing the shot.

157
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:26,210
So my question to you, let's
do kind of the same examples

158
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:27,620
we did with the coins.

159
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:34,140
What's the probability of me
making-- I don't know-- 3 shots

160
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:40,710
in a row, 3 baskets in a row,
or 3 free throws in a row?

161
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,045
I'm going to say free throws
because this is my free

162
00:08:42,045 --> 00:08:45,130
throw percentage, not my
overall shot percentage.

163
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:49,430
Well, by the same logic
it's going to be equal.

164
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,910
The first one I would have to
get right, then the second one

165
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,780
I would have to get-- I would
have to get a basket and

166
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:57,460
there's a 20% I have no basket.

167
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:00,240
And then the third one I
would have an 80% chance

168
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,570
of getting a basket.

169
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:04,060
So this is-- I didn't draw
the rest of the tree.

170
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,430
It gets pretty broad.

171
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:08,940
But in general, just from the
coin example you can just

172
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,046
multiply these probabilities.

173
00:09:10,046 --> 00:09:13,000
   

174
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,460
So 80% is the same thing
as 0.8, so you get 0.8

175
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,080
to the third power.

176
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,780
I don't know, what is that?

177
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,820
Let me see.

178
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:30,940
It is 0.8 times 0.8 times
0.8 is equal to 51.2

179
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:40,340
or 0.512-- 51.2%.

180
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:43,880
So I have slightly better than
even odds of making 3 free

181
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,790
throws in a row, which
is pretty good.

182
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:49,030
And as you can see, I don't
have an exponent on this

183
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:51,380
cheapo Windows provided
calculator I use.

184
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,380
I have to apologize for that.

185
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,465
So we might to limit
our exponent size.

186
00:09:54,465 --> 00:09:57,230
But anyway, that should
hopefully-- well, that's

187
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:57,910
a little bit of a taste.

188
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:00,830
In the next video I'll do a lot
more examples with the free

189
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:02,420
throws and the basket, and
we'll even learn a little bit

190
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,620
about conditional probability.

191
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,270
See you soon.

192
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:05,400
