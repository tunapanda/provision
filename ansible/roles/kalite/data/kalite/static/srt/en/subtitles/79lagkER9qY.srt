1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,520
   

2
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,000
We are on problem 56.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,370
Scott is constructing a line
perpendicular to line

4
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,580
L from point P.

5
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:10,650
Fair enough.

6
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,170
Which of the following should
be his first step?

7
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:15,640
So he wants to draw
a line that looks

8
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,330
something like this.

9
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:18,970
He want to draw it
going straight up

10
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:20,660
through the point P.

11
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:21,710
And so how do you do that?

12
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:23,860
Obviously, if you just use a
ruler, maybe by accident, you

13
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,810
draw it at a slight angle or
something like that, right?

14
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:28,890
So he wants to have
an exact line.

15
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,400
Let's see, I don't even
know what he's doing

16
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,120
in this first one.

17
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,409
He's drawing these x's.

18
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:33,910
I don't know how he's
determining

19
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:36,150
where those x's go.

20
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,810
So that A doesn't look right.

21
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:45,610
Step B, it looks like he kind
of picked two points and is

22
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:48,590
drawing and using his compass to
pivot off of those to kind

23
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,480
of draw arcs there.

24
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,940
But that's still not clear
how it could help.

25
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:55,840
If he knew that he could do some
math and try to figure

26
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,500
out that these are equidistant
from P.

27
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,770
But still, what he wants to do
is find a point right around

28
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,040
there, right below P, where if
he draws a line between P and

29
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,870
that point, it'll be
perpendicular.

30
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:10,850
So that doesn't seem
to be of much help.

31
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:14,480
Here, he picked a point and he's
drawing an arc, but that

32
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,690
arc doesn't really tell
me much information.

33
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:19,690
Let me see, D.

34
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:20,610
This looks interesting.

35
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:25,330
So it looks like he took the
pivot of his compass and he

36
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:27,730
drew a circle around with
a constant radius.

37
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,230
Obviously, that's what
makes it a circle.

38
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:31,830
And then what do he
could do now is he

39
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:32,770
could take his pivot.

40
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:36,740
He could you could mark each
of these points, right?

41
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:42,110
If he marked each of those
points and just pivoted around

42
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:46,040
them and drew a circle, he would
actually-- so let's say

43
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,580
that around that point, he were
to pivot and the circles

44
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:51,530
looks something like--
I don't know.

45
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,325
And he would want to change the
radius a little bit, so

46
00:01:53,325 --> 00:01:55,450
let's say it looks something
like that.

47
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,420
I'm going to try my
best to draw it.

48
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,410
Let's say it looks something
like that.

49
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:03,070
And then around that point,
he does the same thing.

50
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:05,900
He pivots around it.

51
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,000
I guess the two would have to
be big enough to intersect

52
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,250
with each other.

53
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:12,250
   

54
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,890
I know I'm drawing it
really horrible.

55
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,690
The point at which they do
intersect would be equidistant

56
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:19,240
between those two points.

57
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,120
Another way to think about it,
it would be another point

58
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,770
that's equidistant between the
two points, because when you

59
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,210
do it first with P and you
draw that circle, you're

60
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:29,230
saying both of these points
are going to be

61
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:31,080
equidistant from P.

62
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,100
Just by definition, right?

63
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,460
This is a circle and that's
a constant radius.

64
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,070
And then if you were to take
each of those points and draw

65
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,560
circles or draw arcs-- so let's
say from that on you

66
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,920
draw an arc like that and from
that one you draw an arc like

67
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,790
that-- you'd say, wow, this
point is also going to be of a

68
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,840
constant distance from
both of them.

69
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,580
So if I were to draw a line
between both of these points

70
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,810
using a straight edge,
that line will be

71
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:57,210
perpendicular to line L.

72
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,320
So if I were to just do
that, then it would be

73
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:03,070
perpendicular, so I think
D is the first step.

74
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:07,630
All right, problem 57: Which
triangle can be constructed

75
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,950
using the following steps?

76
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,570
OK, this is interesting.

77
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:12,520
A lot of compass work here.

78
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,660
Put the tip of the compass
on point A.

79
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:19,240
   

80
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,940
Open the compass so that the
pencil tip is on point B.

81
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,310
Draw arc above AB.

82
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:29,150
So then they drew this
arc right here.

83
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,770
That's this thing that I'm
trying to color in.

84
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:33,950
Fair enough.

85
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:37,910
Without changing the opening,
put the metal tip on points B,

86
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:41,880
so now you put the pivot
there, and draw an arc

87
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,050
interesting the first
point at C.

88
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:46,360
So now they want us to draw that
second-- let me do it in

89
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:46,640
another color.

90
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,890
They're going to draw
that second arc.

91
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:51,030
   

92
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,210
OK, now draw AC and BC.

93
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:55,830
Now what have we drawn?

94
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:59,900
So when you draw this first
arc-- what they drew is really

95
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,970
a semicircle-- the radius
is constant.

96
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:06,570
So if the radius is constant,
you know that this distance

97
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:10,710
right here is going to be
equal to this distance.

98
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:13,180
They're just both
radiuses of this

99
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,190
semicircle or of this arc.

100
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,579
They're just radiuses.

101
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:19,440
They're equal to the length of
the opening of our compass.

102
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,050
So that's going to
be equal to that.

103
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:23,760
And then when you put the pivot
here and you keep that

104
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:28,110
distance the same, so now the
pencil edge goes here, the

105
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,020
distance is still there.

106
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:32,460
And now when you do this arc,
you now know that this length

107
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,840
is equal to this length, because
now they're both

108
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,030
radiuses of this second arc.

109
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:42,610
So now, you know all three sides
are equal, so this is an

110
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,420
equilateral triangle.

111
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,045
Equilateral, D.

112
00:04:46,045 --> 00:04:49,160
   

113
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,840
OK, the diagram shows
triangle ABC.

114
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,980
Fair enough.

115
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:59,595
Which statement would prove that
ABC is a right triangle?

116
00:04:59,595 --> 00:05:02,630
   

117
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,060
This is clearly not
a right angle.

118
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:08,270
This is probably the right angle
for the right triangle.

119
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,550
And this is something that maybe
you learned in algebra

120
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,610
class, and if you didn't,
you're about to

121
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:14,350
learn it right now.

122
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,470
And I'm looking at
the choices.

123
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:16,720
They talk a lot about slope.

124
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,850
   

125
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:23,800
If I just have a line let's say
here, and it has slope M,

126
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,410
and I want to say what is the
slope on a line that is

127
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:30,550
perpendicular to this
line right here?

128
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:33,000
Well then, it would
look like that.

129
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,735
It would be perpendicular.

130
00:05:33,735 --> 00:05:36,400
It would have a 90-degree angle,
and its slope would be

131
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,390
the negative inverse.

132
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:42,300
The negative inverse of
this first slope.

133
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:47,060
So if the slope from A to B is
a negative inverse of the

134
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,530
slope for B to C, then
we're in business.

135
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:52,110
These are definitely
perpendicular, at least line

136
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:55,130
segments, and this would
be a 90-degree angle.

137
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:57,120
Let's see.

138
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,750
So what did I say?

139
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:12,110
Slope AB, or we could say slope
BC, should be equal to

140
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:22,050
the negative inverse of
the slope of A to B.

141
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:24,300
See, if you multiply both sides
of that times the slope

142
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:36,570
AB, you get slope AB
times slope BC is

143
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:37,400
equal to negative 1.

144
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,470
I just multiplied both sides
times slope of AB.

145
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:45,000
And if we could go here, choice
B is exactly what we

146
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,250
wrote right there.

147
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:53,070
Next problem, 59:
Figure ABC, oh!

148
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,070
It's a parallelogram.

149
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:54,540
Fair enough.

150
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,130
That's parallel to that.

151
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:59,640
That's parallel to that.

152
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,200
What are they asking us?

153
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,200
What are the coordinates of the
point of intersection of

154
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,240
the diagonals?

155
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,650
So what are these coordinates?

156
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:12,330
And we've mentioned it before,
but the big kind of crux of

157
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:15,350
this problem or what you need
to know is that for any

158
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:20,320
parallelogram, the diagonals
bisect each other.

159
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,520
So that means that the distance
from here to here,

160
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:30,060
from O to the intersection
point is equal to the

161
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,500
intersection point to B.

162
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,520
And so this intersection
point is the midpoint.

163
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,640
It is bisected by line AC.

164
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,510
And similarly, you can make the
argument that this line

165
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:43,760
segment right here is equal
to-- is congruent

166
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,010
to that line segment.

167
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:49,730
   

168
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:54,500
If this is really the midpoint
between O and B, then we just

169
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,280
have to find the midpoint
of their coordinates.

170
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,590
And the way to find the midpoint
of two coordinates is

171
00:07:58,590 --> 00:07:59,700
actually very intuitive.

172
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,830
You just average the
coordinates.

173
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:11,420
So if I were to average the
x's-- so the x-coordinate here

174
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:15,490
is going to be-- the
x-coordinate of point B, which

175
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:19,340
is A plus C, plus the
x-coordinate of the origin

176
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:22,700
which is 0 over 2,
because I had two

177
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,690
points that I'm averaging.

178
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:26,570
So that's going to be
the x-coordinate.

179
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,880
And then y-coordinate is going
to be the y-coordinate

180
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:34,039
coordinate of B plus the
y-coordinate of the origin.

181
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:34,850
I'm just averaging them.

182
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:38,610
The y-coordinate of the origin
is 0 divided by 2.

183
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,390
This will give me the coordinate
of the midpoint

184
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,950
between origin and B.

185
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:51,680
So that equals A plus C over 2
and then B over 2, so this is

186
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,920
A plus C over 2.

187
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,290
That makes sense because A plus
C is going to be here

188
00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:00,710
someplace, and we just took the
average of the two between

189
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,680
zero and that, and you
got the midpoint.

190
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,920
And then the y-coordinate is
going to be B over 2, which

191
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,970
makes sense because that up
there is B and we're just

192
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:13,045
halfway between B and zero.

193
00:09:13,045 --> 00:09:15,800
So it's A plus C over
2, B over 2.

194
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,070
And is that one of
the choices?

195
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:22,210
A plus C over 2, I'm assuming
that they want us to do choice

196
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:25,140
C and they just forgot to
type the B in there.

197
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,020
This is supposed to be a B.

198
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,170
Because this is definitely
not right.

199
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,100
That's not right.

200
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,620
And we know that this is right,
but it's not A plus

201
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,890
something over on this side.

202
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:34,610
It's just B over 2 on
the y-coordinate.

203
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:35,880
So that's not right.

204
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,270
All right, problem 60.

205
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:40,580
I tried to squeeze it in.

206
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,290
I don't know if you can
see the whole problem.

207
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:47,300
But it says what type of
triangle is formed by the

208
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:53,560
points A is 4 comma 2, B is 6
comma negative 1, and C is

209
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,460
negative 1 comma 3?

210
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:58,030
So I think the best thing is to
just try to graph it and at

211
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,490
least start getting an
intuition, and then we can see

212
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:02,970
the distances between the
points, and hopefully, figure

213
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:05,510
out what type of
triangle it is.

214
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,720
So let's see, some
of the points get

215
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,090
a little bit negative.

216
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:11,080
I'll have to draw some of
the negative quadrants.

217
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,880
   

218
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,320
So if I were to draw
it like that.

219
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,120
OK, let's see.

220
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,570
So 4 comma 2.

221
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:30,490
   

222
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:31,340
That's right there.

223
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,340
That's point A.

224
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,150
And then I have 6 comma
negative 1.

225
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:42,860
   

226
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,500
That's point B.

227
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,060
I don't know if you can
see it down there.

228
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,320
And C is negative 1 comma 3.

229
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:55,823
   

230
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:57,510
So it's out here.

231
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:01,260
   

232
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,290
Now let me connect the dots.

233
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:08,700
That's one side, that's another
side, and that's the

234
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,290
other side.

235
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:11,450
So off the bat, I just
know this isn't going

236
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:12,420
to be a right triangle.

237
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,990
It's not an equilateral
triangle.

238
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:17,455
And the only way it's going to
be an isosceles triangle is if

239
00:11:17,455 --> 00:11:20,600
this length is equal to that
length, so let's just try it.

240
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,280
Let's just test it out.

241
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,170
So what is the distance
from A to C?

242
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:30,490
   

243
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:35,240
The distance squared from A to
C is equal to the differences

244
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,630
in their x's.

245
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:40,060
So 4 minus negative
1, so there's a

246
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,905
difference of 5, right?

247
00:11:41,905 --> 00:11:46,260
So there's a difference in
their x's squared plus a

248
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,140
difference in their y's.

249
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,910
So 2 and 3.

250
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,170
You could just say 2 minus
3 or 3 minus is 2.

251
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:53,580
It doesn't matter.

252
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,690
We just care about
the difference.

253
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:58,050
Plus one squared.

254
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:02,080
So the distance squared
is equal to 25 plus

255
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,540
1 is equal to 26.

256
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:07,580
So this distance is the
square root of 26.

257
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:10,630
And the distance between
A and B, same logic.

258
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:13,720
Let's see, when you go from
the distance squared, the

259
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,210
difference is in there x's.

260
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,740
Between 6 and 4, you have a
distance of 2, so it's 2

261
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,810
squared plus the difference
in their y's.

262
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:24,770
2 and negative 1 are
3 apart, right?

263
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:27,990
Plus 3 squared.

264
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:33,486
And so that is equal to 4 plus
9, which is equal to 13, so

265
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:36,090
this is equal to the
square root of 13.

266
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:38,480
OK, and this number down here,
you can figure it out, but

267
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,570
it's going to be bigger than
both of them, right?

268
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:42,260
You can just look at
it and say that.

269
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,040
So this is definitely
a scalene triangle.

270
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,550
All of the sides
are different.

271
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:49,020
Anyway, see you in
the next video.
