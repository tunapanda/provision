00:00:00,743 --> 00:00:03,887
Find the probability of pulling a yellow marble from a bag

2
00:00:03,887 --> 00:00:06,870
with 3 yellow, 2 red, 2 green,

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,852
and 1 blue (I'm assuming) marble.

4
00:00:09,852 --> 00:00:12,700
The probability (I'll just say 'P' for probability)

5
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:17,484
The probability of picking a yellow marble.

6
00:00:17,484 --> 00:00:20,666
So this is sometimes the event in question right over here,

7
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:21,806
picking the yellow marble.

8
00:00:21,806 --> 00:00:24,303
I'll even write down the word, 'picking'.

9
00:00:24,303 --> 00:00:25,566
And when you say probability,

10
00:00:25,566 --> 00:00:27,801
it's really just a way of measuring the likelihood

11
00:00:27,801 --> 00:00:29,518
that something's going to happen.

12
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:31,835
And the way were going to think about it is,

13
00:00:31,835 --> 00:00:35,149
how many of the outcomes from this trial,

14
00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:37,349
from this picking a marble out of the bag,

15
00:00:37,349 --> 00:00:40,917
how many meet our constraints, satisfy this event?

16
00:00:40,917 --> 00:00:43,950
And how many possible outcomes are there?

17
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,482
So let me write the possible outcomes right over here,

18
00:00:46,482 --> 00:00:52,083
so possible outcomes.

19
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:54,833
And you'll see it's actually a very straight forward idea.

20
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:56,503
But I'll just make sure we understand

21
00:00:56,503 --> 00:00:58,831
all the words that people might say.

22
00:00:58,831 --> 00:01:01,186
So the set of all the possible outcomes:

23
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:02,537
Well, there's three yellow marbles.

24
00:01:02,537 --> 00:01:03,908
So I could pick that yellow marble,

25
00:01:03,908 --> 00:01:08,568
that yellow marble or that yellow marble.

26
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,470
These are clearly all yellow.

27
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,260
There's two red marbles in the bag.

28
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:16,747
So I could pick that red marble, or that red marble.

29
00:01:16,747 --> 00:01:19,578
There's two green marbles in the bag.

30
00:01:19,578 --> 00:01:23,217
So I could pick that green marble, or that green marble.

31
00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:25,949
And then there's one blue marble in the bag.

32
00:01:25,949 --> 00:01:27,890
There's one blue marble.

33
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:30,506
So this is all the possible outcomes

34
00:01:30,506 --> 00:01:31,831
and sometimes this is referred to

35
00:01:31,831 --> 00:01:34,817
as the sample space.

36
00:01:34,817 --> 00:01:37,249
sample...the set of all the possible outcomes,

37
00:01:37,249 --> 00:01:39,195
fancy word for just a simple idea.

38
00:01:39,195 --> 00:01:42,251
When I pick something out of the bag

39
00:01:42,251 --> 00:01:44,565
and that picking out of the bag is called a trial.

40
00:01:44,565 --> 00:01:46,693
There's eight possible things that I can do.

41
00:01:46,693 --> 00:01:49,663
So when I think of the probability of picking a yellow marble,

42
00:01:49,663 --> 00:01:52,830
I want to think about, well what are all the possibilities?

43
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:56,978
Well, there's eight possibilities for my trial.

44
00:01:56,978 --> 00:02:02,208
So the number of possible outcomes,

45
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:04,735
you could view it as the size of the sample space,

46
00:02:04,735 --> 00:02:06,496
number of possible outcomes.

47
00:02:06,496 --> 00:02:07,756
And it's as simple as saying,

48
00:02:07,756 --> 00:02:09,614
look I have eight marbles.

49
00:02:09,614 --> 00:02:11,928
And you say how many of those marbles meet my constraint,

50
00:02:11,928 --> 00:02:14,543
that satisfy this event here?

51
00:02:14,543 --> 00:02:17,794
Well, there's three marbles that satisfy my event.

52
00:02:17,794 --> 00:02:22,613
There's three outcomes that will allow this event to occur.

53
00:02:22,613 --> 00:02:24,044
I guess this is one way to say it.

54
00:02:24,044 --> 00:02:25,711
So there're three right over here.

55
00:02:25,711 --> 00:02:33,473
So number that satisfy the event,

56
00:02:33,473 --> 00:02:35,288
or the constraint right over here.

57
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:38,078
So very simple ideas, but many times the words

58
00:02:38,078 --> 00:02:40,420
make them more complicated than they need to.

59
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:43,127
If I say what is the probability of picking a yellow marble,

60
00:02:43,127 --> 00:02:46,195
well how many different types of marbles can I pick?

61
00:02:46,195 --> 00:02:48,576
Well there's eight different marbles I could pick

62
00:02:48,576 --> 00:02:50,732
And then how many are yellow?

63
00:02:50,732 --> 00:02:55,479
Well, there's three of them that are actually yellow.
