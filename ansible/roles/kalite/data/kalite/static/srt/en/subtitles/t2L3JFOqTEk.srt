1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,508
In the last video

2
00:00:01,508 --> 00:00:03,090
we got some practice

3
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:06,052
adding what we could consider smaller numbers.

4
00:00:06,052 --> 00:00:09,553
For example, if we added 3 + 2

5
00:00:09,553 --> 00:00:11,034
we could imagine that if

6
00:00:11,034 --> 00:00:15,033
maybe I had three lemons -- 1, 2, 3 --

7
00:00:15,033 --> 00:00:17,856
and if I were to add to those three lemons

8
00:00:17,856 --> 00:00:21,608
maybe two lime-- Is it lime or limes?

9
00:00:21,608 --> 00:00:24,312
Let's just -- Well, two green lemons --

10
00:00:24,312 --> 00:00:26,497
or two more tart pieces of fruit

11
00:00:26,497 --> 00:00:30,630
How many-- how much tart, sour fruit do I have now?

12
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,080
Well, we learned in the last video

13
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:37,662
we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 pieces of fruit.

14
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:39,624
So 3 + 2 = 5.

15
00:00:39,624 --> 00:00:40,791
And we also saw that

16
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:42,009
that's the exact same thing as if

17
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:44,631
we add 2 + 3.

18
00:00:44,631 --> 00:00:45,966
And I think that makes sense.

19
00:00:45,966 --> 00:00:47,137
Because this is the same thing as

20
00:00:47,137 --> 00:00:49,313
starting with -- Maybe you have 2 lemons

21
00:00:49,313 --> 00:00:52,110
and you add 3 limes to it.

22
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,990
You're still going to end up with 5 pieces of fruit.

23
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,899
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

24
00:00:57,899 --> 00:00:59,021
Just like that.

25
00:00:59,021 --> 00:01:00,815
So it doesn't matter what order you add in.

26
00:01:00,815 --> 00:01:02,263
You're still going to get five.

27
00:01:02,263 --> 00:01:04,522
And this way of thinking about addition

28
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:07,229
I view as the counting way of thinking about addition

29
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:08,994
The other thing we saw in the last video

30
00:01:08,994 --> 00:01:09,918
is the number line version

31
00:01:09,918 --> 00:01:12,309
And they're essentially the same thing

32
00:01:12,309 --> 00:01:13,882
So we could draw a line.

33
00:01:13,882 --> 00:01:15,465
And all a number line is

34
00:01:15,465 --> 00:01:17,300
it lists all of the numbers in order.

35
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,446
It lists all of the numbers.

36
00:01:18,446 --> 00:01:20,023
And you can actually go as high as you need to go

37
00:01:20,023 --> 00:01:22,771
You could go up to a million, gazillion, trillion.

38
00:01:22,771 --> 00:01:23,826
We won't do that.

39
00:01:23,826 --> 00:01:26,024
I wouldn't have space or time in this video to do it.

40
00:01:26,024 --> 00:01:27,468
And you actually can go as low as possible.

41
00:01:27,468 --> 00:01:29,151
We'll start at 0, assuming --

42
00:01:29,151 --> 00:01:30,668
In future videos, I'll tell you

43
00:01:30,668 --> 00:01:32,911
about numbers smaller than 0.

44
00:01:32,911 --> 00:01:35,758
Maybe you can think about what that might mean tonight.

45
00:01:35,758 --> 00:01:38,795
But let's start at 0, and 0 means nothing.

46
00:01:38,795 --> 00:01:44,156
If I have 0 lemons, it means I have no lemons.

47
00:01:44,156 --> 00:01:56,379
So: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 --

48
00:01:56,379 --> 00:01:57,305
Let's go pretty high.

49
00:01:57,305 --> 00:01:58,119
12 --

50
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:00,380
That way I can reuse the number line.

51
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,477
13, 14.

52
00:02:02,477 --> 00:02:03,445
I could keep on going

53
00:02:03,445 --> 00:02:05,474
But maybe 14 will be enough for this video

54
00:02:05,474 --> 00:02:06,727
But let's use a number line

55
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:08,726
for these addition problems up here.

56
00:02:08,726 --> 00:02:11,311
So in the last video -- just as a bit of a review --

57
00:02:11,311 --> 00:02:14,169
you can view 3 + 2 as starting at 3 --

58
00:02:14,169 --> 00:02:15,879
and then adding 2 to it.

59
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:18,026
Or going two greater than 3.

60
00:02:18,026 --> 00:02:21,070
And just going greater --

61
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,280
or adding on the number line --

62
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,491
is just moving to the right -- or moving up by two.

63
00:02:23,491 --> 00:02:24,933
So let's move up by two.

64
00:02:24,933 --> 00:02:27,947
I'll do that in this orange color.

65
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:29,725
So let's go up by 2.

66
00:02:29,725 --> 00:02:32,377
So we started at three and we go up by one.

67
00:02:32,377 --> 00:02:34,295
And then we go up by 2, or we're jumping,

68
00:02:34,295 --> 00:02:36,360
and we end up at 5.

69
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,068
Which is exactly what we got before.

70
00:02:38,068 --> 00:02:39,493
If we have three lemons

71
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:40,609
we add one lemon, we have four lemons.

72
00:02:40,609 --> 00:02:43,877
We add another lemon, we have 5 lemons --

73
00:02:43,877 --> 00:02:45,728
or limes -- or tart pieces of fruit.

74
00:02:45,728 --> 00:02:47,243
Whatever you might want to say.

75
00:02:47,243 --> 00:02:48,727
And when you look at this version of it --

76
00:02:48,727 --> 00:02:50,509
when you switched the order --

77
00:02:50,509 --> 00:02:52,498
We started at 2

78
00:02:52,498 --> 00:02:54,553
and we're adding 3 objects to it.

79
00:02:54,553 --> 00:02:58,134
In this case, they were lemons or limes.

80
00:02:58,134 --> 00:02:59,865
So we're going to add three to it.

81
00:02:59,865 --> 00:03:03,256
1, 2, 3.

82
00:03:03,256 --> 00:03:04,980
And just like we expected,

83
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,348
we got the same thing.

84
00:03:06,348 --> 00:03:08,188
We got 5 again.

85
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,613
Now what I want to do in this video --

86
00:03:09,613 --> 00:03:11,990
and hopefully this was just a bit of a review --

87
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,716
-- is I want to tackle harder problems.

88
00:03:13,716 --> 00:03:16,017
I want to tackle slightly larger numbers.

89
00:03:16,017 --> 00:03:17,367
And then in the next video --

90
00:03:17,398 --> 00:03:18,373
And in this video I want to just

91
00:03:18,373 --> 00:03:20,081
give you practice dealing

92
00:03:20,081 --> 00:03:21,071
with the slightly larger numbers.

93
00:03:21,071 --> 00:03:21,854
And then, in the next video

94
00:03:21,854 --> 00:03:23,098
we're going to dig a little deeper

95
00:03:23,098 --> 00:03:25,154
and think about what numbers even mean

96
00:03:25,154 --> 00:03:27,357
But let's just get some practice understanding

97
00:03:27,357 --> 00:03:31,901
"How do you actually do the addition problems with larger numbers?"

98
00:03:31,901 --> 00:03:36,813
Let me write it in a nice, soothing, purple color.

99
00:03:36,813 --> 00:03:44,501
Let's say I wanted to add 9 + 3.

100
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:46,991
Well, there are a couple of ways we could do it.

101
00:03:46,991 --> 00:03:48,989
We could draw circles again.

102
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:50,654
We could say, let's see, I have --

103
00:03:50,654 --> 00:03:55,039
Maybe I'll draw stars. 1, 2, 3, 4 --

104
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:56,742
My stars are degrading,

105
00:03:56,742 --> 00:04:02,167
-- 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

106
00:04:02,167 --> 00:04:05,526
That's 9 stars. And then I add 3 stars to it.

107
00:04:05,526 --> 00:04:09,695
So I add 1, 2, 3 stars.

108
00:04:09,695 --> 00:04:10,485
And then if you were to count

109
00:04:10,485 --> 00:04:12,155
the total number of stars, you would say --

110
00:04:12,155 --> 00:04:14,400
(Let me do that in a different color.)

111
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:21,195
-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

112
00:04:21,195 --> 00:04:23,167
I now have 12 stars.

113
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:28,217
So, you would say that 9 + 3 = 12.

114
00:04:28,217 --> 00:04:29,448
It's equal to 12.

115
00:04:29,448 --> 00:04:31,653
If you looked at the number line --

116
00:04:31,653 --> 00:04:33,457
If you looked at the number line, you're, starting at 9.

117
00:04:33,457 --> 00:04:34,964
Maybe you have 9 stars

118
00:04:34,964 --> 00:04:39,796
and you add 1 star, 2 stars, 3 stars to that.

119
00:04:39,796 --> 00:04:42,231
And you end up with 12 stars.

120
00:04:42,231 --> 00:04:45,133
Which is the exact answer we got before.

121
00:04:45,133 --> 00:04:48,164
So you can do the same process when you start

122
00:04:48,164 --> 00:04:51,353
adding larger numbers, even though that now --

123
00:04:51,353 --> 00:04:53,074
And I want you to notice, the difference now is

124
00:04:53,074 --> 00:04:56,207
our answer has two digits in it.

125
00:04:56,207 --> 00:04:58,039
(And we'll talk more about digits in a future video.)

126
00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:00,487
But all a digit is is a numeral. Right?

127
00:05:00,487 --> 00:05:01,857
It has a 1 and a 2.

128
00:05:01,857 --> 00:05:02,824
That's what 12 is.

129
00:05:02,824 --> 00:05:05,474
I won't go into -- I won't dig too deep into that right now.

130
00:05:05,474 --> 00:05:08,151
I think you're pretty familiar with the number 12.

131
00:05:08,151 --> 00:05:09,344
But what I want to do is --

132
00:05:09,344 --> 00:05:12,018
Now what happens when you start adding more?

133
00:05:12,018 --> 00:05:13,101
When you start adding

134
00:05:13,101 --> 00:05:16,488
two-digit numbers like this?

135
00:05:16,488 --> 00:05:30,556
For example, if I were to add 27 plus -- let's say --

136
00:05:30,556 --> 00:05:34,705
I don't know -- plus15. (27 + 15.)

137
00:05:34,705 --> 00:05:36,923
Now, if you had a lot of time on your hands

138
00:05:36,923 --> 00:05:39,697
and you didn't care about how people judged you

139
00:05:39,697 --> 00:05:42,408
you could draw out 27 circles,

140
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:44,869
and then draw out another 15 circles and then

141
00:05:44,869 --> 00:05:47,247
count the total number of circles you had.

142
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:48,585
And that would give you an answer.

143
00:05:48,585 --> 00:05:49,922
Or you could draw a number line

144
00:05:49,922 --> 00:05:51,913
You could draw a number line that

145
00:05:51,913 --> 00:05:55,272
went all the way to whatever 27 + 15 is.

146
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:56,884
So it's going to be this really, really large number,

147
00:05:56,884 --> 00:05:59,156
but that wouldtake you forever.

148
00:05:59,156 --> 00:06:00,137
So what I'm going to do

149
00:06:00,137 --> 00:06:00,997
is show you a way to

150
00:06:00,997 --> 00:06:02,428
do this type of problem

151
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:04,741
where you really just have to know your addition

152
00:06:04,741 --> 00:06:06,406
almost have it memorized, or at least

153
00:06:06,406 --> 00:06:07,721
if you don't have it memorized

154
00:06:07,721 --> 00:06:08,955
be able to do something like this for

155
00:06:08,955 --> 00:06:10,323
relatively small numbers.

156
00:06:10,323 --> 00:06:12,246
And by doing it for the relatively small numbers,

157
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:15,676
you can do the harder problems like this.

158
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:17,555
So what you do, this is the fun part.

159
00:06:17,555 --> 00:06:20,906
You add, and I'll talk more about

160
00:06:20,906 --> 00:06:22,552
what this means in the future.

161
00:06:22,552 --> 00:06:24,604
You look at each of the digits.

162
00:06:24,604 --> 00:06:26,873
So we call this place, the rightmost place

163
00:06:26,873 --> 00:06:30,924
we call that the ones place.

164
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:32,733
And why do we call that the ones place?

165
00:06:32,733 --> 00:06:37,406
Because 27 is 20 and 7 ones.

166
00:06:37,406 --> 00:06:40,405
It's twenty plus seven.

167
00:06:40,405 --> 00:06:42,823
It's twenty plus seven ones.

168
00:06:42,823 --> 00:06:45,372
You could view it as it's twenty plus seven pennies.

169
00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:49,955
And this place right here is called the tens place.

170
00:06:49,955 --> 00:06:51,540
Now why is it called the tens place?

171
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,351
I mean there's a two right there.

172
00:06:53,351 --> 00:06:55,290
It's the place that's called the tens place.

173
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,989
So putting a two here means two tens.

174
00:06:57,989 --> 00:07:00,588
The number twenty, that's two tens.

175
00:07:00,588 --> 00:07:03,423
If I have one dime and you gave me another dime

176
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,658
I now have two dimes, and that's twenty cents

177
00:07:06,658 --> 00:07:08,059
So that's what the tens place is.

178
00:07:08,059 --> 00:07:09,221
I don't want to confuse you

179
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:10,142
I just want to show you how to

180
00:07:10,142 --> 00:07:10,973
do these problems right now.

181
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:13,850
We'll dig a little bit deeper in future videos.

182
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,305
But I just want to give you that idea.

183
00:07:15,305 --> 00:07:17,380
But the way to do these problems is

184
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,962
you look at the numbers in the ones place

185
00:07:19,962 --> 00:07:22,155
and add those up first.

186
00:07:22,155 --> 00:07:23,625
So you say, OK, I'm not going to worry about

187
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:24,676
this whole thing right now.

188
00:07:24,676 --> 00:07:28,101
Let me just add the seven and the five.

189
00:07:28,101 --> 00:07:30,402
So I'm going to add the seven and the five.

190
00:07:30,402 --> 00:07:32,770
And if you don't know what that is

191
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:33,993
hopefully you'll be able to do that

192
00:07:33,993 --> 00:07:35,876
in your head fairly shortly

193
00:07:35,876 --> 00:07:36,390
-- you could look

194
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,652
at the number line.

195
00:07:37,652 --> 00:07:39,569
Let's look at the number line here.

196
00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:40,847
So if you add seven

197
00:07:40,847 --> 00:07:43,740
if you take seven, and you add five to it.

198
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:47,986
-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 --

199
00:07:47,986 --> 00:07:49,401
We end up at twelve.

200
00:07:49,401 --> 00:07:50,969
Or if you started at five and added seven

201
00:07:50,969 --> 00:07:52,890
you'd also end up at twelve.

202
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,000
So let's write that down.

203
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,155
We know that 7 + 5 = 12.

204
00:07:59,155 --> 00:08:02,905
So what we do is we say 7 + 5 is equal to

205
00:08:02,905 --> 00:08:04,503
-- and now this is a new thing.

206
00:08:04,503 --> 00:08:06,626
It might be a little bit of a mystery

207
00:08:06,626 --> 00:08:08,889
magical thing for you right now.

208
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:11,450
And in future videos I'll explain to you why this works.

209
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,645
We write -- we want to write the 12.

210
00:08:13,645 --> 00:08:17,671
7 + 5 is 12. But we just write the 2 here

211
00:08:17,671 --> 00:08:19,708
and we carry the 1.

212
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,254
12. one, two

213
00:08:21,254 --> 00:08:23,011
Well, we wrote the 2 there,

214
00:08:23,011 --> 00:08:25,470
but we put the 1 up here, right?

215
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:26,300
And the reason --

216
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,903
(I'll give you a simple reason for doing that right now.)

217
00:08:28,903 --> 00:08:30,575
(I'll give you a better reason in the future.)

218
00:08:30,575 --> 00:08:34,830
-- Is that you only had space to put one digit here

219
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,656
and twelve is a two-digit number

220
00:08:36,656 --> 00:08:38,251
so we had to think of some

221
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:39,441
other place to put that 1.

222
00:08:39,441 --> 00:08:41,318
If you really want to think about it even more

223
00:08:41,318 --> 00:08:42,910
12 is the same thing

224
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:46,120
as 10 + 2, right?

225
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,326
That's the same thing as 12.

226
00:08:48,326 --> 00:08:52,450
So if we say 7 + 5, that's the same thing as 12

227
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:55,044
which is the same thing as two ones. Right?

228
00:08:55,044 --> 00:08:59,704
Two 1s. 2 pennies, plus 1 dime.

229
00:08:59,704 --> 00:09:01,762
Plus 1 ten. Plus 1 dime.

230
00:09:01,762 --> 00:09:04,119
So we put that 1 dime in the 10s place.

231
00:09:04,119 --> 00:09:08,459
So we really just said 7 + 5 is one 10 plus two 1s.

232
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:11,253
Or 1 dime plus 2 pennies.

233
00:09:11,253 --> 00:09:14,351
If that confuses you, just write, just say,

234
00:09:14,351 --> 00:09:16,754
well I just write the 1s digit of the 2 there

235
00:09:16,754 --> 00:09:18,652
and I carry the 1.

236
00:09:18,652 --> 00:09:21,056
And then you do the exact same thing in the 10s place.

237
00:09:21,056 --> 00:09:23,317
You add the 1 plus the 2 plus the 1.

238
00:09:23,317 --> 00:09:26,340
So 1 + 2 -- Let's do that on a number line.

239
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,518
This is fun.

240
00:09:27,518 --> 00:09:28,291
So let's see.

241
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:29,512
1 + 2.

242
00:09:29,512 --> 00:09:31,141
Let's start -- let me do it in a vibrant color.

243
00:09:31,141 --> 00:09:32,747
(Let me do it in this magenta.)

244
00:09:32,747 --> 00:09:34,522
So we start at one.

245
00:09:34,522 --> 00:09:36,043
We're going to add two to it.

246
00:09:36,043 --> 00:09:37,255
1 + 2.

247
00:09:37,255 --> 00:09:39,190
We take that 1 from our 12..

248
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:41,742
1 + 2. So you go up 1, 2.

249
00:09:41,742 --> 00:09:43,099
You end up at 3.

250
00:09:43,099 --> 00:09:44,692
Then you're going to add up another one.

251
00:09:44,692 --> 00:09:46,009
So you add another 1.

252
00:09:46,009 --> 00:09:48,311
You're going to end up at 4.

253
00:09:48,311 --> 00:09:50,739
So you ended up at 42.

254
00:09:50,739 --> 00:09:52,297
And this was pretty neat, right?

255
00:09:52,297 --> 00:09:53,806
Because we didn't have to

256
00:09:53,806 --> 00:09:55,401
draw a number line all the way to 42.

257
00:09:55,401 --> 00:09:57,293
And we'd didn't have to draw 42 objects.

258
00:09:57,293 --> 00:09:59,524
Just by knowing what 7 + 5 was

259
00:09:59,524 --> 00:10:02,504
and by knowing what 1 + 2 + 1 was

260
00:10:02,504 --> 00:10:03,922
we were able to figure out that

261
00:10:03,922 --> 00:10:07,290
27 + 15 = 42.

262
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:08,555
Let's do another example.

263
00:10:08,555 --> 00:10:10,325
Maybe I'll do a little bit of a simpler example.

264
00:10:10,325 --> 00:10:19,017
Let's say I had 78 + 3.

265
00:10:19,017 --> 00:10:21,705
We do the exact same thing as before.

266
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:23,561
We just look at the 1s place only.

267
00:10:23,561 --> 00:10:25,367
So we look at 8 + 3.

268
00:10:25,367 --> 00:10:27,630
What's 8 + 3?

269
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,570
Hopefully, we can do that

270
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:29,782
in our heads at this point.

271
00:10:29,782 --> 00:10:30,607
But let's just think about it.

272
00:10:30,607 --> 00:10:33,297
8 + 1 = 9.

273
00:10:33,297 --> 00:10:36,203
8 + 2 = 10.

274
00:10:36,203 --> 00:10:38,732
8 + 3 is going to be equal to 11.

275
00:10:38,732 --> 00:10:40,185
You could do that on the number line

276
00:10:40,185 --> 00:10:42,327
if it makes it easier to visualize for you.

277
00:10:42,327 --> 00:10:45,293
So 8 + 3 = 11.

278
00:10:45,293 --> 00:10:50,724
So what we do here, we just have 8 + 3 = 11.

279
00:10:50,724 --> 00:10:53,690
Put this one right here, put that there

280
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,207
and carry the other one.

281
00:10:55,207 --> 00:10:55,878
Because eleven is

282
00:10:55,878 --> 00:10:58,690
one ten -- one dime -- plus one penny.

283
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:00,023
That's eleven.

284
00:11:00,023 --> 00:11:01,738
And then we add the tens place.

285
00:11:01,738 --> 00:11:06,790
1 dime plus 7 dimes is equal to 8 dimes.

286
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:11,158
So 78 + 3 = 81.

287
00:11:11,158 --> 00:11:12,328
And now there's one thing I want to show you.

288
00:11:12,328 --> 00:11:15,775
You don't always have to carry numbers like that.

289
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:17,278
Only if the answer to one of these

290
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:19,109
has more than one digit in it.

291
00:11:19,109 --> 00:11:21,308
11 is a two-digit number.

292
00:11:21,308 --> 00:11:28,493
So, for example, if I have 56 + 2.

293
00:11:28,493 --> 00:11:31,757
Here, I could just say 6 + 2 is 8. Right?

294
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:34,860
Hopefully, we're getting good practice at this.

295
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,027
So 6 + 2 = 8.

296
00:11:37,027 --> 00:11:39,727
And then, I don't have anything to add this 5 to.

297
00:11:39,727 --> 00:11:41,575
So, I just bring the five down here.

298
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:44,530
So 56 + 2 = 58.

299
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:45,785
Just like that.

300
00:11:45,785 --> 00:11:46,968
And this is one you actually

301
00:11:46,968 --> 00:11:48,057
could have drawn on the number line.

302
00:11:48,057 --> 00:11:49,161
It wouldn't have been too hard.

303
00:11:49,161 --> 00:11:51,028
So, if you were to draw the number line like that,

304
00:11:51,028 --> 00:11:54,120
0 would be way off to the left some place.

305
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,655
But let's say I had 50, no I think you'd have 49

306
00:11:56,655 --> 00:11:57,662
you could keep going to the left

307
00:11:57,662 --> 00:11:59,933
but you have 51, 52 --

308
00:11:59,933 --> 00:12:02,050
Actually let me start a little higher than that.

309
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:04,388
Because I'm going to run out of space.

310
00:12:04,388 --> 00:12:11,589
Let me start at maybe 55, 56, 57, 58, 59 --

311
00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:13,347
And I could go in both directions -- keep going.

312
00:12:13,347 --> 00:12:17,631
But if we start at fifty-six right there and we add two

313
00:12:17,631 --> 00:12:20,098
We go up one, we go up two.

314
00:12:20,098 --> 00:12:21,451
We end up at 58.

315
00:12:21,451 --> 00:12:23,289
So just like, that we're able to do that problem.

316
00:12:23,289 --> 99:59:59,999
I'll see you in the next video.
