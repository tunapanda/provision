1
00:00:00,418 --> 00:00:02,347
In this video we are gonna talk a little bit

2
00:00:02,347 --> 00:00:04,906
about order of operations.

3
00:00:04,906 --> 00:00:06,990
And I want you to pay close attention

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:08,757
because, really, EVERYTHING else that

5
00:00:08,757 --> 00:00:10,793
you are gonna do in mathematics is going to be based on

6
00:00:10,793 --> 00:00:14,524
your having a solid grounding in Order of Operations.

7
00:00:14,524 --> 00:00:15,931
So, what are we even talk...mean,

8
00:00:15,931 --> 00:00:17,554
when we say Order of Operations?

9
00:00:17,554 --> 00:00:18,808
So let me give you an example.

10
00:00:18,808 --> 00:00:21,420
The whole point, is so we have one way

11
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,650
to interpret a mathematical statment.

12
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:26,239
So let‘s say I have the mathematical statement:

13
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:32,293
7 plus 3, times 5.

14
00:00:32,293 --> 00:00:36,511
Now if we didn't all agree on Order of Operations,

15
00:00:36,511 --> 00:00:39,335
there would be 2 ways of interpreting this statement.

16
00:00:39,335 --> 00:00:41,424
You could just read it left-to-right.

17
00:00:41,424 --> 00:00:44,506
So you could say "well, let me just take 7 + 3."

18
00:00:44,506 --> 00:00:49,319
You could say 7 + 3 and then multiply that times 5 -

19
00:00:49,319 --> 00:00:53,249
and 7+3 is 10.

20
00:00:53,249 --> 00:00:56,657
and then you multiply that by 5.

21
00:00:56,657 --> 00:00:59,924
10 x 5, it would get you 50.

22
00:00:59,924 --> 00:01:01,645
So, that's one way you would interpret it

23
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:03,597
if we didn't agree on an order of operations -

24
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:05,810
maybe it's a natural way - you just go left-to-right.

25
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:07,252
Another way you could interpret it -- you say

26
00:01:07,252 --> 00:01:10,403
"oh, I like to do multiplication before I do addition"

27
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:14,397
so you might interpret it as - I'll try to color code it -

28
00:01:14,397 --> 00:01:17,926
7+ ... and you do the 3x5 first

29
00:01:17,926 --> 00:01:24,425
7 + 3x5 which would be 7+

30
00:01:24,425 --> 00:01:32,750
3x5 is 15 ... and 7+15 is 22.

31
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,713
So notice we interpreted this statement in two different ways

32
00:01:35,713 --> 00:01:37,756
this was just straight left-to-right,

33
00:01:37,756 --> 00:01:39,985
doing the addition, then the multiplication.

34
00:01:39,985 --> 00:01:41,916
This way, we did the multiplication first,

35
00:01:41,916 --> 00:01:43,840
then the addition. We get 2 different answers.

36
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,868
That's just not cool in mathematics.

37
00:01:45,868 --> 00:01:50,388
If this was part of some effort to send something to the Moon

38
00:01:50,388 --> 00:01:52,233
because 2 people interpreted it a different way

39
00:01:52,233 --> 00:01:54,106
or 1 computer interpreted it one way

40
00:01:54,106 --> 00:01:55,448
and another computer interpreted it another way -

41
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,301
the satellite might go to Mars!

42
00:01:57,301 --> 00:01:59,401
So this is just completely unacceptable,

43
00:01:59,401 --> 00:02:00,721
and that's why we have to have

44
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:03,129
an agreed upon Order of Operations.

45
00:02:03,129 --> 00:02:06,644
an agreed upon way to interpret this statement.

46
00:02:06,644 --> 00:02:09,402
So, the agreed upon order of operations

47
00:02:09,402 --> 00:02:11,177
is to do parentheses first.

48
00:02:11,177 --> 00:02:12,934
-- let me write it over here --

49
00:02:12,934 --> 00:02:19,913
'parentheses' first. then do exponents.

50
00:02:19,913 --> 00:02:21,258
If you don't know what exponents are,

51
00:02:21,258 --> 00:02:24,731
don't worry about it right now. In this video

52
00:02:24,731 --> 00:02:27,913
we're not going to have exponents in our examples.

53
00:02:27,913 --> 00:02:30,409
So you don't really have to worry about it for this video.

54
00:02:30,409 --> 00:02:31,974
Then you do multiplication -

55
00:02:31,974 --> 00:02:35,686
I'll just write "mult" short for multiplication.

56
00:02:35,686 --> 00:02:37,928
Then you do multiplication and division next.

57
00:02:37,928 --> 00:02:40,652
they kind of have the same level of priority.

58
00:02:40,652 --> 00:02:47,553
And then finally you do addition and subtraction.

59
00:02:47,553 --> 00:02:49,867
So, what is this order of operations?

60
00:02:49,867 --> 00:02:51,185
Let me label it - this right here is,

61
00:02:51,185 --> 00:02:56,131
that is the agreed upon order of operations

62
00:02:56,131 --> 00:02:58,350
and if we follow these order of operations

63
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,309
we should always get to the same answer

64
00:03:00,309 --> 00:03:02,656
for a given statement. So what does this tell us?

65
00:03:02,656 --> 00:03:05,281
What is the best way to interpret this up here?

66
00:03:05,281 --> 00:03:07,049
Well, we have no parentheses -

67
00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:08,811
parentheses look like that,

68
00:03:08,811 --> 00:03:10,637
these little curly things around numbers.

69
00:03:10,637 --> 00:03:12,329
We don't have any parentheses here -

70
00:03:12,329 --> 00:03:15,111
I'll do some examples that do have parentheses.

71
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,835
We don't have any exponents here,

72
00:03:16,835 --> 00:03:18,983
but we do have some multiplication and division

73
00:03:18,983 --> 00:03:20,853
or we actually just have some multiplication.

74
00:03:20,853 --> 00:03:22,862
So the order of operations say

75
00:03:22,862 --> 00:03:25,351
'do the multiplication and division first'.

76
00:03:25,351 --> 00:03:28,320
So it says do the multiplication first -

77
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,402
that's a multiplication. So it says do this operation first.

78
00:03:32,402 --> 00:03:36,735
It gets priority over addition or subtraction.

79
00:03:36,735 --> 00:03:39,508
So if we do this first, we get the three times five,

80
00:03:39,508 --> 00:03:42,679
which is fifteen, and then we add the seven.

81
00:03:42,679 --> 00:03:44,723
The addition or subtraction - I'll do it here

82
00:03:44,723 --> 00:03:47,866
we just have addition - just like that.

83
00:03:47,866 --> 00:03:49,901
So we do the multiplication first, get 15,

84
00:03:49,901 --> 00:03:52,326
then add the 7 ... 22

85
00:03:52,326 --> 00:03:56,113
So based upon the agreed order of operations,

86
00:03:56,113 --> 00:03:59,375
this right here is the correct answer -

87
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,594
the correct way to interpret this statement.

88
00:04:01,594 --> 00:04:03,482
Let's do another example.

89
00:04:03,482 --> 00:04:08,082
I think it'll make things a little bit more clear.

90
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:10,467
And I'll do the example in pink.

91
00:04:10,467 --> 00:04:17,932
So let's say I have 7+3

92
00:04:17,932 --> 00:04:19,871
- put some parentheses there -

93
00:04:19,871 --> 00:04:30,652
x 4 divided by 2 - 5 x 6.

94
00:04:30,652 --> 00:04:32,435
So there's all sorts of crazy things here,

95
00:04:32,435 --> 00:04:34,836
but if you just follow the Order of Operations,

96
00:04:34,836 --> 00:04:37,767
you'll simplify it in a very clean way

97
00:04:37,767 --> 00:04:39,409
and hopefully we'll all get the same answer.

98
00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:41,631
So let's just follow the order of operations.

99
00:04:41,631 --> 00:04:43,752
The first thing we have to do is look for parentheses.

100
00:04:43,752 --> 00:04:46,023
Are there parentheses here? Yes, there are!

101
00:04:46,023 --> 00:04:48,798
There's parentheses around the 7+3.

102
00:04:48,798 --> 00:04:53,937
So it says, "lets do that first". So 7+3 is 10.

103
00:04:53,937 --> 00:04:55,339
So this we can simplify

104
00:04:55,339 --> 00:04:57,183
- just looking at this order of operations -

105
00:04:57,183 --> 00:05:01,256
to 10 times all of that. Let me copy and paste that,

106
00:05:01,256 --> 00:05:03,996
so I don't have to keep rewriting it.

107
00:05:03,996 --> 00:05:06,870
So, let me copy. Let me paste it.

108
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:10,079
So that simplifies to ten times all of that -

109
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:13,330
we did our parentheses first. Then what do we do?

110
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,362
There are no more parentheses in this expression.

111
00:05:15,362 --> 00:05:16,686
Then we should do exponents.

112
00:05:16,686 --> 00:05:18,199
I don't see any exponents here.

113
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:20,145
and just so if you are curious what exponents would look like

114
00:05:20,145 --> 00:05:21,423
an exponent would look like

115
00:05:21,423 --> 00:05:23,153
- you know, seven squared -

116
00:05:23,153 --> 00:05:25,699
You'd see these little small numbers up in the top right.

117
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:27,067
We don't have any exponents here,

118
00:05:27,067 --> 00:05:27,935
so we don't have to worry about it.

119
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:32,742
Then it says to do multiplication and division next.

120
00:05:32,742 --> 00:05:34,199
So where do we see multiplication -

121
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:38,826
we have a multiplication, a division, a multiplication again.

122
00:05:38,826 --> 00:05:43,795
Now, when you have multiple operations at the same level

123
00:05:43,795 --> 00:05:46,164
and in our order of operations, multiplication and division

124
00:05:46,164 --> 00:05:50,482
are at the same level - then you do left-to-right.

125
00:05:50,482 --> 00:05:54,141
So in this situation, you're going to multiply by 4

126
00:05:54,141 --> 00:05:59,166
and then divide by 2. You won't multiply by 4 divided by 2.

127
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:03,717
Then we'll do the 5 times 6 before we do the subtraction,

128
00:06:03,717 --> 00:06:06,504
right here. So let's figure out what this is.

129
00:06:06,504 --> 00:06:08,984
So we'll do this multiplication first.

130
00:06:08,984 --> 00:06:10,427
We'll do that multiplication first -

131
00:06:10,427 --> 00:06:12,422
we could simultaneously do this multiplication

132
00:06:12,422 --> 00:06:13,769
cause it's not going to change things,

133
00:06:13,769 --> 00:06:16,053
but I'll do things one step at a time.

134
00:06:16,053 --> 00:06:20,111
So the next step we're going to do is this 10x4.

135
00:06:20,111 --> 00:06:25,733
10x4 is 40

136
00:06:25,733 --> 00:06:28,433
Then you have 40 divided by 2

137
00:06:28,433 --> 00:06:32,204
- let me copy and paste all of that again -

138
00:06:32,204 --> 00:06:34,414
Then it simplifies to that right there.

139
00:06:34,414 --> 00:06:35,992
Remember multiplication and division,

140
00:06:35,992 --> 00:06:38,426
they are at the exact same level -

141
00:06:38,426 --> 00:06:40,000
so we're going to do it left-to-right.

142
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,006
You xould also express this as multiplying by one-half

143
00:06:43,006 --> 00:06:45,510
and then it wouldn't matter the order. But for simplicity

144
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:49,333
multiplication / division go left-to-right.

145
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:53,116
So then you have 40 divided by 2 minus 5 times 6.

146
00:06:53,116 --> 00:06:55,207
So, division - you just have 1 division here -

147
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:57,680
You want to do that. This is going to take...

148
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,183
You have this division and this multiplication.

149
00:07:00,183 --> 00:07:01,229
They are not together.

150
00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:03,671
So you can actually kind of do them simultaneously.

151
00:07:03,671 --> 00:07:07,015
And to make it clear that you do this before you do the subtraction,

152
00:07:07,015 --> 00:07:11,605
because multiplication/division take priority over addition/subtraction

153
00:07:11,605 --> 00:07:13,191
we can put parentheses around them.

154
00:07:13,191 --> 00:07:16,387
Just say "look, we're gonna do that and that first,

155
00:07:16,387 --> 00:07:18,428
BEFORE I do that subtraction"

156
00:07:18,428 --> 00:07:22,355
because multiplication / division have priority.

157
00:07:22,355 --> 00:07:25,480
So 40 divided by 2 is 20.

158
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,317
We're going to have that minus sign.

159
00:07:27,317 --> 00:07:31,071
-5 times 6 is 30.

160
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:35,668
20 minus 30 is equal to negative 10.

161
00:07:35,668 --> 00:07:39,012
And that is the correct interpretation of that.

162
00:07:39,012 --> 00:07:41,035
So I want to make something very, very, very clear:

163
00:07:41,035 --> 00:07:45,667
if you have things at the same level

164
00:07:45,667 --> 00:07:51,922
so if you have 1 + 2 - 3 + 4 - 1

165
00:07:51,922 --> 00:07:55,253
so addition and subtraction are at the same level

166
00:07:55,253 --> 00:07:58,352
in order of operations - you should go left-to-right.

167
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:01,455
You should interpret this as 1+2 is 3.

168
00:08:01,455 --> 00:08:05,872
So this is the same thing as 3 - 3 + 4 - 1.

169
00:08:05,872 --> 00:08:10,316
Then you do 3 - 3 is 0, + 4, - 1.

170
00:08:10,316 --> 00:08:13,424
OR this is the same thing as 4 - 1

171
00:08:13,424 --> 00:08:16,675
which is the same thing as 3 - you just go left to right.

172
00:08:16,675 --> 00:08:20,529
Same thing if you have multiplication and division

173
00:08:20,529 --> 00:08:22,666
all on the same level.

174
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:29,400
So if you have 4x2, divided by 3, times 2,

175
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:35,344
you do 4x2 is 8, divided by 3, times 2

176
00:08:35,344 --> 00:08:39,338
and you say 8 divided by 3 is - well you get a fraction there -

177
00:08:39,338 --> 00:08:44,353
it would be 8/3. So this would be 8/3 times 2.

178
00:08:44,353 --> 00:08:50,855
And 8/3 times 2 is equal to 16/3.

179
00:08:50,855 --> 00:08:53,362
THAT's how you interpret it - you don't do this multiplication first,

180
00:08:53,362 --> 00:08:56,335
and then divide the 2 by that, and all of that.

181
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:59,815
Now the one time you can be loosey-goosey with order of operations

182
00:08:59,815 --> 00:09:03,184
is if you have ALL addition or ALL multiplication.

183
00:09:03,184 --> 00:09:08,713
So if you have 1+5+7+3+2

184
00:09:08,713 --> 00:09:11,052
does not matter what order you do it in.

185
00:09:11,052 --> 00:09:12,267
You could do the two plus three;

186
00:09:12,267 --> 00:09:13,564
you could go from the right to the left;

187
00:09:13,564 --> 00:09:14,539
you could go from the left to the right;

188
00:09:14,539 --> 00:09:15,886
you could start some place in between -

189
00:09:15,886 --> 00:09:18,337
if it's ONLY all addition -

190
00:09:18,337 --> 00:09:20,989
and the same thing is true if you have ALL mutliplication -

191
00:09:20,989 --> 00:09:24,933
if it's 1 times 5 , times 7, times 3, times 2

192
00:09:24,933 --> 00:09:28,192
does not matter what order you are doing it in.

193
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:32,140
That's only with all multiplication OR all addition.

194
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,682
If there's some division in here or some subtraction in here,

195
00:09:34,682 --> 00:09:39,267
you're best off just going left-to-right.
