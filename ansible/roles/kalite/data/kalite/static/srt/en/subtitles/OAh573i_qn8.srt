1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,670
   

2
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:02,920
Let's do some more matrix
multiplication examples,

3
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:06,020
because I think it is all about
seeing as many examples

4
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:07,220
as possible.

5
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:11,040
So let's do what may seem to be
a more difficult problem,

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,520
and it might not be even
clear that we can

7
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,740
multiply these matrices.

8
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,760
And maybe that's the first thing
we should think about.

9
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,635
So let's say I wanted to
multiply the matrix-- I'll do

10
00:00:18,635 --> 00:00:22,670
it relatively small so we
don't run out of space.

11
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:33,510
3, 1, 2, minus 2, 0, 5.

12
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:43,320
Let's say I want to multiply
that times the matrix, minus

13
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:51,900
1, 0, 2, 3, 5, 5.

14
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,360
I'm just making up
these numbers.

15
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,000
So the first thing you might
be wondering is, well can I

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,500
even multiply these matrices?

17
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,177
Because you know from the
first video we did on

18
00:01:00,177 --> 00:01:03,040
matrices, that you can't
add these two matrices.

19
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,180
This term corresponds to this
one; this one corresponds to

20
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,920
this one; but this term
corresponds to nothing over

21
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,280
here so you couldn't add or
subtract these matrices.

22
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,160
So the question is, can I
multiply these matrices?

23
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,140
Well, what did we learn about
multiplying matrices?

24
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,780
We know that, for example, if
this is going to result in

25
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,360
some matrix--

26
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,540
However we don't know even what
the dimensions are yet

27
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,630
until we work through this
example, although there is a

28
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,470
quick way for figuring it out.

29
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:31,910
So this first term here, the
upper left term, where does it

30
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:34,080
get its row information from
and where does it get its

31
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,890
column information from?

32
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,610
Well, it gets its row
information from here.

33
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:45,280
So it is essentially this
row times which column?

34
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,430
Times this column, right?

35
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,210
And we can actually take the dot
product of this row vector

36
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:57,060
and this column vector because
they have the same length.

37
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,380
This is a column vector but it
has a length of 3, right?

38
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:03,520
But it's a 3 by 1, it has
three elements in it.

39
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,240
And this is a 1 by 3 row vector,
but it also has three

40
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:06,730
elements in it.

41
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:09,270
So we actually can take the
dot product or we can

42
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,770
multiply these two.

43
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:14,500
And similarly we can multiply
this times this whole thing to

44
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,950
get this term right here.

45
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:19,380
And we can multiply this thing
times this thing to get this

46
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,730
term, and then this
thing times that

47
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:23,350
term to get that term.

48
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:26,100
So it actually turns out that
you can-- so what kind of a

49
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:26,880
matrix is this?

50
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,080
Let's call it that this is
matrix-- let me switch to

51
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,920
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

52
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,830
So this is matrix A.

53
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:35,640
And what are it's dimensions?

54
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,640
It has 2 rows, 1, 2,
and 3 columns.

55
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,130
So it's a 2 by 3 matrix.

56
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:45,530
   

57
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:46,970
We're multiplying it times B.

58
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:50,980
   

59
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,320
And what are B's dimensions?

60
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,670
Well, it has 3 rows, 1, 2, 3.

61
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:57,920
So it is a 3 by-- and how many
columns does it have?

62
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,700
1, 2-- 2 matrix.

63
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:04,160
So it turns out that we can
multiply two matrices.

64
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,710
You can say that the number--
if, on the first matrix-- the

65
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:12,750
number of columns is equal to
the number of rows in the

66
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,360
second matrix.

67
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,190
So here, 2 by 3 times 3
by 2, we can multiply.

68
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:21,120
For example, we could
have multiplied, if

69
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,840
this is matrix C.

70
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,410
I don't know if I take
so much time to keep

71
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:26,440
bolding these things.

72
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,710
And I don't care how
many rows it has.

73
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:34,580
It can have n rows,
n times a columns.

74
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:39,380
I can multiply it times
matrix D, as long as

75
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,990
matrix D has a rows.

76
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:45,430
As long as you can say these
two inner numbers are the

77
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:45,950
same, right?

78
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,130
This 3 is the same as 3.

79
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,250
And why does that matter,
what was the logic?

80
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,490
Because this row will have 3
elements because there's 3

81
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:55,470
columns, and each column
vector here will have 3

82
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,050
elements, because
there's 3 rows.

83
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,760
That's where intuition comes
from, but if you had to do it

84
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,990
really quickly you say 2 by 3,
3 by 2, this number is equal

85
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:04,160
to that number, I
can multiply.

86
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,040
So let me clear up some
space and let's do the

87
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,220
multiplication.

88
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,470
Let's do some multiplication.

89
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:12,630
   

90
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,920
I'm debating where I should do
it, actually I think I should

91
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,550
do it down here maybe because
I'll have more space.

92
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,500
So let me do it down there;
I don't have to

93
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,529
erase anything else.

94
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:24,700
So let me get some
space ready.

95
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:28,250
OK, this will take up
a lot of space.

96
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:32,150
So to get this row 1, column
1 element, what do I do?

97
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,420
I multiply this vector
times this vector.

98
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,040
I take the dot product, right?

99
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,020
So it's 3 times negative 1-- I'm
just going to write it all

100
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:47,600
-- 3 times minus 1, plus 1
times 0, plus 2 times 2.

101
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,090
   

102
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,170
There, we got the first term.

103
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:55,350
So the second term here,
what am I going to do?

104
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:59,500
I'm going to multiply that
vector times that row vector

105
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,200
times this column vector.

106
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,830
And I think you're getting the
hang of this, and really the

107
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,970
hardest part about this is
staying focused and not making

108
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:08,290
a careless mistake.

109
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:09,820
And not getting it confused
with rows and

110
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,360
columns and all that.

111
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,290
It just sends blood to your
brain, but it's not

112
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:14,920
that hard, I think.

113
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,440
So what do we do?

114
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,880
We multiply this row vector
times this column vector to

115
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,420
get row 1, column 2, right?

116
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:25,030
Because this row,
row 1, column 2.

117
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:36,030
3 times 3, plus 1 times 5,
plus 2 times 5, right.

118
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:40,230
We're just multiplying the
corresponding terms, the third

119
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,200
term times the third term, the
second term times the second

120
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,620
term, the first term times
the first term.

121
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,340
Although, in this case they're
going down, in this case

122
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,830
they're going left and right.

123
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,150
Oh, we add them all up.

124
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:52,240
OK, so now we're in the second
row, and we get our row

125
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,890
information from the first
vector-- and let me do a red

126
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:57,630
that I never use because I think
it's kind of tacky, this

127
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,320
red right here.

128
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,720
So I'm going to multiply
this row vector

129
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,790
times this column vector.

130
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:11,530
So it's minus 2 times minus
1, plus 0 times 0,

131
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:13,015
plus 5 times 2.

132
00:06:13,015 --> 00:06:15,900
   

133
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,900
We're almost done.

134
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,550
Let me see-- I don't like this
color at all-- and now we're

135
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,760
going to multiply this row,
because we're in this bottom

136
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:27,390
row, we're in row 2, column
2, to row 2, column 2.

137
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:42,720
So it's minus 2 times 3, plus
0 times 5, plus 5 times 5.

138
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,310
And then if we simplify, let's
see, this is minus 3 plus 0,

139
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:51,110
plus 4, so this-- if I have
my math correct--

140
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,460
simplifies to 1.

141
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:59,450
9 plus 5 is 14, plus 10 is 24.

142
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:06,170
This is 1, 24, and then minus 2
times minus 1 is 2, plus 10,

143
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,970
so this is 12.

144
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:14,830
And then minus 2 times 3 is
minus 6, plus 10-- this is 0--

145
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,290
so minus 6 plus 10 is 4.

146
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:18,710
So that's interesting.

147
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:22,070
When I multiplied a 2 by 3
vector times a 3 by 2 vector,

148
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,090
what did I get?

149
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:26,640
I got a 2 by 2 matrix.

150
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,930
A 2 by 3 matrix, a 2 by 3 times
3 by 2 matrix, I got a 2

151
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,180
by 2 matrix.

152
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,160
And where do you see a 2 by 2?

153
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,255
Well, it's like this got
multiplied with this, and what

154
00:07:37,255 --> 00:07:40,700
we have left over is
a 2 by 2 matrix.

155
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,580
So in general-- well actually,
before I go into the general,

156
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,610
let me ask you a question.

157
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:47,060
Could I have multiplied the
matrices the other way?

158
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:51,710
Could I have multiplied-- so
this right here that is A

159
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:55,100
times B, or you can sometimes
write this AB, and we'd bold

160
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,840
it all up so we know
it's matrices.

161
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,300
So could we have multiplied
B times A?

162
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,450
Let me clear this down
here and let's try.

163
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:05,450
Let's see if we can multiply
B times A.

164
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:08,150
I think you can already suspect
that, since I'm asking

165
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:10,820
the question, maybe
you cannot.

166
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,180
Let's clear up some space.

167
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:16,470
Let's try to do it the other
way around, let's try to

168
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,550
multiply B times A.

169
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:28,000
So B is minus 1,
0, 2, 3, 5, 5.

170
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,730
And A is-- I'm switching
the order-- 3, 1,

171
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:34,130
2, minus 2, 0, 5.

172
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:36,140
And I tend to put brackets
around my matrices.

173
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,960
Some people have these
big parentheses.

174
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:42,039
It's just all notation; there's
nothing particular

175
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,590
about notation.

176
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,510
So let's see if you can
multiply these.

177
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:48,830
So we learned that you get the
row information from the first

178
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,220
matrix and the column
information

179
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:50,950
from the second one.

180
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:57,530
So this term, in theory, should
be that row times what?

181
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:00,800
   

182
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,730
Well, actually, it turns out
that you can multiply them.

183
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:04,140
Why?

184
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:09,470
Because this is a 3 by 2, and
this is a 2 by 3, right?

185
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:12,360
So we're going to take that row
times what?-- times this

186
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,010
column to get the first
term, right?

187
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:16,820
So what is it going to be?

188
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,310
It's going to be minus 1.

189
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:20,540
So I actually thought I was
doing a counter example, but

190
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,930
actually because this too is the
same as this, or when you

191
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:27,400
switch the row this is
the same as this, you

192
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,160
can multiply them.

193
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,040
So I wanted to do a counter
example, but hey.

194
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,290
Let's just work through this
because it never hurts to see

195
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:33,020
another example.

196
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,200
And you can see that I just
do this on the fly.

197
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:34,910
So let's do this.

198
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:38,380
And actually ahead of time, how
large will this matrix be?

199
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,560
Well, this is interesting.

200
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,100
It's actually going to
be a 3 by 3 matrix,

201
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,030
a much bigger matrix.

202
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:45,370
Let's work it all out, and maybe
you want to pause it and

203
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:46,030
try it yourself.

204
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:57,640
This row times this column, so
minus 1 times 3, it's minus 3,

205
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,930
3 times minus 2 is minus 6.

206
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:06,330
And then it's going to be this
row times this column.

207
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:09,980
So it's minus 1 times 1 plus
3 times 0, so that's

208
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,640
just minus 1, right?

209
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,250
Because 3 times 0 is 0.

210
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:17,100
And then, that was that one,
then there's the middle one,

211
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,580
and now we get the
row 1, column 3.

212
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,750
So row 1, column 3.

213
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,750
So it's that row times
this column.

214
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:27,670
You can tell, this is often
better done by a computer.

215
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:32,140
Minus 1 times 2 is minus 2 plus
15-- 3 times 5-- so minus

216
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,940
2 plus 5 is 13.

217
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,330
Let's keep going.

218
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:39,030
So now we're going to take--

219
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:42,760
I'm sweating, this is so
computationally intensive--

220
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,670
We're taking this row times
each of these columns.

221
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:46,770
And actually we are going to
learn later that there are

222
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:49,880
multiple ways of actually
thinking about how this

223
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,130
multiplication happens, even
multiple ways by computer, but

224
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:53,840
this is the traditional way.

225
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,070
So this row times each of
these columns, right?

226
00:10:56,070 --> 00:11:01,830
So 0, 5, so 0 times 3 plus 5
times minus 2, that's minus

227
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:06,830
10, and it's 0 times
1 plus 5 times 0.

228
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,840
That's easy, that's 0.

229
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:14,150
0 times 2 plus 5 times
5 is 25-- almost

230
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,690
there, almost done.

231
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:18,580
Now we're going to take this row
and multiply it times each

232
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,320
of these columns.

233
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:25,620
So 2 times 3, that's 6,
plus minus 10, so

234
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,700
that's minus 4, right?

235
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,330
2 times 3 plus 5
times minus 2.

236
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:33,470
Yes, that's minus 4,
6 minus 10, right?

237
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:36,670
We have 2 times 1 plus
5 times 0, that's 2.

238
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:43,590
Then you have 2 times 2 plus 5
times 5, so 4 plus 25 is 29.

239
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:48,180
And of course that first term,
minus 3 minus 6, so

240
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,640
this is minus 9.

241
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,840
So there you have it.

242
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:55,160
We multiplied the 3 by 2 matrix
times a 2 by 3 matrix,

243
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,960
and we got a 3 by 3 matrix.

244
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,240
And where did that
3 by 3 come from?

245
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,970
Because this 3 is the number of
rows in the first matrix,

246
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:05,720
and this 3 is the number of
columns in the second matrix,

247
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,130
which makes sense because we got
our row information from

248
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:10,830
the first matrix and our column
information from the

249
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,300
second matrix.

250
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,610
Now let me actually show
you an example

251
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:18,360
that you cannot multiply.

252
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,120
So what if I wanted to multiply
a-- let me do a very

253
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:26,680
simple example-- what if
I wanted to multiply

254
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,850
the matrix, 2, 1.

255
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,430
And really, all this is,
is a row vector.

256
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:43,720
And let's say that I wanted to
multiply this times-- I don't

257
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:48,160
know, so this is a 2 by 1.

258
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,080
So then let me say I want to
multiply this times-- so let

259
00:12:52,080 --> 00:13:04,270
me think of something--
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

260
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:06,860
Now, can I multiply this?

261
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,450
Well, what do we have?

262
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:10,950
This is a 3 by 2 matrix.

263
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:13,560
Can I multiply these
two matrices?

264
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,960
Well, what do we have to do?

265
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,680
We get our row information
from here, and our column

266
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,440
information from here--

267
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,080
Oh sorry, this isn't 2 by 1,
this is 1 row, two columns.

268
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,390
This is a 1 by 2, right?

269
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,770
That's a 1 by 2 matrix.

270
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:30,150
So can you multiply the 1 by
2 times a 3 by 2 matrix?

271
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:33,545
So we get our row information
from here, so we essentially

272
00:13:33,545 --> 00:13:37,490
have to multiply this by this
times this column to get our

273
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:39,360
first element, then this
times this column to

274
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,260
get our second element.

275
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,760
And I don't know what happens
from there, but let me-- well,

276
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,110
can we multiply?

277
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:46,700
Just the way we have defined our
multiplication, or the dot

278
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,390
product, can we multiply?

279
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:52,600
Let's see, 2 times
1 plus 1 times 2.

280
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,440
Then we don't have anything
to do with the 3.

281
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,470
So the way that we've defined
matrix multiplication, you

282
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,110
cannot multiply these
two matrices.

283
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:01,060
And you didn't have to go
through that exercise.

284
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:03,930
You could've looked at the
dimensions, 1 by 2, and this

285
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:06,780
is a 3 by 2.

286
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:11,020
This 2 is not equal to this 3,
the number of columns in the

287
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:14,080
first are not equal to the
number of rows in the second.

288
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,250
So you can not multiply
those two matrices.

289
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,270
So that's something interesting
to think about.

290
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:22,050
And they're actually examples,
and it's a good exercise for

291
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:26,100
you to think about it, where
you can multiply A times B,

292
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,270
but you can't multiply
B times A.

293
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:30,930
So I want you think about
examples where that happens.

294
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:34,540
But anyway, I'm pushing 15
minutes, and I will see you in

295
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,190
the next video.

296
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:36,500
