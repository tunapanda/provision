99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's say I have two intersecting line segments. So lets call that segment AB.

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then I have segment CD

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So that is C and that is D.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And they intersect right over here at point E.

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And let's say we know, we're given, that this angle right over here, the measure of angle BED is 70 degrees.

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Given that information, what I want to do

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
,based on only what we know so far, not using a protractor...

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
What I want to do is figure out what the other angles in this picture are.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So what are the measures of angles CEB, AEC and AED?

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So the first thing that you might notice when you look at this is that angle BED and CEB are adjacent.

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we also see that if you take the outer sides of those angles it forms a strait angle.

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we also see that angle CED is a strait angle.

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we know that these two angles must also be suplementary.

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They are next to each other and they form a strait angle when you take their outer sides.

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we know that angle BED and angle CEB are suplementary,

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
which means they add up to or their measures add up to 180 degrees.

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Suplementary angles, which tells us that the measure of BED plus the measure of angle CEB

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is equal to 180 degrees.

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now we already know the measure of angle BED is 70 degrees.

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we alredy know that this thing right over here is 70 degrees.

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so 70 degrees plus the measure of angle CEB is 180 degrees.

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We substract 70 degrees from the both sides and we get the measure of angle CEB is equal to 110 degrees.

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I just substracted 70 degrees from both sides of that.

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we figured out that this right over here is 110 degrees.
