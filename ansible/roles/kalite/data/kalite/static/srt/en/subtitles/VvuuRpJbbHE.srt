1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,580
   

2
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:05,170
Use completing the square to
find the value of c that makes

3
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:08,890
x squared minus 44x plus c--
so we can just figure out a

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:11,690
c-- that makes it a perfect
square trinomial-- and a

5
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:14,590
trinomial is just a polynomial
with three terms here.

6
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,990
Then write the expression as
the square of a binomial.

7
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:23,690
So we have x squared
minus 44x plus c.

8
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,370
So how do we make this into
a perfect square?

9
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,460
Well, if you just look at the
traditional pattern for a

10
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:29,920
perfect square, let's
just think of it in

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,350
terms of x plus a squared.

12
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:37,860
That's the same thing as x plus
a times x plus a, and

13
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,260
we've seen this before.

14
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:42,150
And if you were to multiply this
out, that's x times x,

15
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:48,170
which is x squared, plus
x times a, which is ax.

16
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:50,850
Plus a times x, which is ax.

17
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,490
Plus a times a, which
is a squared.

18
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:59,365
So it's x squared plus 2ax,
these two, you have an ax plus

19
00:00:59,365 --> 00:01:03,610
an ax gives you 2ax,
plus a squared.

20
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:06,820
So if we can get this into this
pattern, where I have

21
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:10,120
whatever value is here, if
I take half of it, right?

22
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,490
This is going to be 2a here.

23
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,240
If I take half of it and square
it over here, then this

24
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,150
will be a perfect square.

25
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:21,530
So if we look over here, this
thing right here is 2a, if we

26
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:23,960
want to pattern match, if we
want to make this look like a

27
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,070
perfect square.

28
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,300
That has to be 2a.

29
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,550
So negative 44 is equal to 2a.

30
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:32,790
And this, right here, this c, if
we pattern match, c has to

31
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:36,770
be equal to a squared.

32
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,100
So what's a?

33
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,000
Well, if we know negative 44
is 2a, we can divide both

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,140
sides of that by 2.

35
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:50,310
And we know that negative 22
has got to be equal to a. a

36
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,770
has got to be equal
to negative 22.

37
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,190
a is half of the coefficient
right here.

38
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:58,100
It's half of negative 44.

39
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,250
And whenever you complete the
square, it's always going to

40
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:02,420
be half of the coefficient
right here.

41
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,840
Now, if that's a, what
does c need to be?

42
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,800
Well, c needs to be a squared
in order for this to be a

43
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,430
perfect square.

44
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:14,880
So c needs to equal negative
22 squared.

45
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,390
And we can figure out
what that is.

46
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:20,880
22 times 22, we could put the
negative later-- actually it's

47
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,390
just going to be the same thing
because the negative

48
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,040
times a negative
is a positive.

49
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,900
2 times 22 is 44, put a 0.

50
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,580
2 times 22 is 44.

51
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,200
Get a 4, get an 8, get a 4.

52
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,950
So it's 484.

53
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:41,350
So if we were to rewrite this
as x squared minus 44x plus

54
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:47,030
484, then this is a perfect
square trinomial.

55
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,050
Or we could write
it like this.

56
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:53,130
This is x squared minus 2
times-- or maybe I should

57
00:02:53,130 --> 00:03:00,750
write it this way-- plus 2
times negative 22x plus

58
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,350
negative 22 squared.

59
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:06,140
And when you view it that way,
it's pretty clear that this is

60
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,170
a perfect square, and if you
were to factor it, it's the

61
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:14,040
same thing as x minus
22 times x minus 22,

62
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,980
or x minus 22 squared.

63
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,530
These are all equivalent
statements.

64
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:21,400
