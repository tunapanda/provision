1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,540
   

2
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,520
Use completing the square to
write the quadratic equation y

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:09,390
is equal to negative 3x squared,
plus 24x, minus 27 in

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:12,920
vertex form, and then
identify the vertex.

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,340
So we'll see what vertex form
is, but we essentially

6
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,880
complete the square, and we
generate the function, or we

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,440
algebraically manipulate it so
it's in the form y is equal to

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:29,970
A times x minus B
squared, plus C.

9
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,390
We want to get the equation
into this form right here.

10
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:37,450
This is vertex form
right there.

11
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:40,770
And once you have it in vertex
form, you'll see that you can

12
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,280
identify the x value of the
vertex as what value will make

13
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,790
this expression equal to 0.

14
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:47,740
So in this case it would be B.

15
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:52,540
And the y value of the vertex,
if this is equal to 0, then

16
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,590
the y value is just
going to be C.

17
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:55,470
And we're going to see that.

18
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:58,480
We're going to understand why
that is the vertex, why this

19
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,310
vertex form is useful.

20
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,310
So let's try to manipulate
this equation to get

21
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:03,650
it into that form.

22
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:06,060
So if we just rewrite it, the
first thing that immediately

23
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,490
jumps out at me, at least, is
that all of these numbers are

24
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:10,790
divisible by negative 3.

25
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:13,170
And I just always find it
easier to manipulate an

26
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,920
equation if I have a 1
coefficient out in front of

27
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,680
the x squared.

28
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,390
So let's just factor
out a negative 3

29
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:19,670
right from the get-go.

30
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:25,040
So we can rewrite this as y is
equal to negative 3 times x

31
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,470
squared, minus 8x-- 24 divided
by negative 3 is

32
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:32,752
negative 8-- plus 9.

33
00:01:32,752 --> 00:01:36,790
Negative 27 divided by negative
3 is positive 9.

34
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:40,410
Let me actually write the
positive 9 out here.

35
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,950
You're going to see in a second
why I'm doing that.

36
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:46,020
Now, we want to be able to
express part of this

37
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,290
expression as a perfect
square.

38
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:48,950
That's what vertex
form does for us.

39
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:52,170
We want to be able to express
part of this expression as a

40
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,160
perfect square.

41
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,525
Now how can we do that?

42
00:01:54,525 --> 00:01:57,650
Well, we have an x
squared minus 8x.

43
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:01,250
So if we had a positive 16
here-- because, well, just

44
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,675
think about it this way, if we
had negative 8, you divide it

45
00:02:03,675 --> 00:02:05,160
by 2, you get negative 4.

46
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,110
You square that, it's
positive 16.

47
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,870
So if you had a positive
16 here, this would

48
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:10,639
be a perfect square.

49
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,450
This would be x minus
4 squared.

50
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:17,300
But you can't just willy-nilly
add a 16 there, you would

51
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,075
either have to add a similar
amount to the other side, and

52
00:02:20,075 --> 00:02:22,000
you would have to scale it by
the negative 3 and all of

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,580
that, or, you can just subtract
a 16 right here.

54
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,840
I haven't changed
the expression.

55
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,630
I'm adding a 16, subtracting
a 16.

56
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,370
I've added a 0.

57
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:30,770
I haven't it changed it.

58
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:36,890
But what it allows me to do is
express this part of the

59
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,160
equation as a perfect square.

60
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,830
That right there is
x minus 4 squared.

61
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,240
And if you're confused, how
did I know it was 16?

62
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,720
Just think, I took negative
8, I divided by 2, I

63
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,980
got negative 4.

64
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,300
And I squared negative 4.

65
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,640
This is negative 4 squared
right there.

66
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,790
And then I have to subtract that
same amount so I don't

67
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,130
change the equation.

68
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:00,190
So that part is x
minus 4 squared.

69
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:06,190
And then we still have this
negative 3 hanging out there.

70
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:11,690
And then we have negative 16
plus 9, which is negative 7.

71
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,230
So we're almost there.

72
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,860
We have y equal to negative 3
times this whole thing, not

73
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,350
quite there.

74
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,880
To get it there, we just
multiply negative 3.

75
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,480
We distribute the negative 3 on
to both of these terms. So

76
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:26,820
we get y is equal to negative
3 times x, minus 4 squared.

77
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:32,390
And negative 3 times negative
7 is positive 21.

78
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:35,520
So we have it in our vertex
form, we're done with that.

79
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,860
And if you want to think about
what the vertex is, I told you

80
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:39,270
how to do it.

81
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,670
You say, well, what's the
x value that makes

82
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:43,680
this equal to 0?

83
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,860
Well, in order for this term to
be 0, x minus 4 has to be

84
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,130
equal to 0.

85
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:51,950
x minus 4 has to be equal to 0,
or add 4 to both sides. x

86
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:53,530
has to be equal to 4.

87
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:56,580
And if x is equal to 4, this is
0, this whole thing becomes

88
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:01,000
0, then y is equal to 21.

89
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,420
So the vertex of this parabola--
I'll just do a

90
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:08,850
quick graph right here-- the
vertex of this parabola occurs

91
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,960
at the point 4, 21.

92
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,500
So I'll draw it like this.

93
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,480
Occurs at the point.

94
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:21,550
If this is the point 4, if this
right here is the-- so

95
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,960
this is the y-axis, that's
the x-axis-- so this is

96
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,920
the point 4, 21.

97
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,590
Now, that's either going to be
the minimum or the maximum

98
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:31,860
point in our parabola, and to
think about whether it's the

99
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,280
minimum or maximum point, think
about what happens.

100
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,300
Let's explore this equation
a little bit.

101
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:44,040
This thing, this x minus 4
squared is always greater than

102
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,170
or equal to 0.

103
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:45,510
Right?

104
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:48,330
At worst it could be 0, but
you're taking a square, so

105
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,560
it's going to be a non-negative
number.

106
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,160
But when you take a non-negative
number, and then

107
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,860
you multiply it by negative 3,
that guarantees that this

108
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:00,660
whole thing is going to be
less than or equal to 0.

109
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,750
   

110
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,550
So the best, the highest, value
that this function can

111
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:10,360
attain, is when this
expression right

112
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,630
here is equal to 0.

113
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,680
And this expression is equal
to 0 when x is equal

114
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,810
to 4 and y is 21.

115
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:18,360
So this is the highest value
that the function can attain.

116
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,660
It can only go down
from there.

117
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:24,510
Because if you shift the x
around 4, then this expression

118
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:27,850
right here will become, well,
it'll become non-zero.

119
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,910
When you square it, it'll
become positive.

120
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,225
When you multiply it
by negative 3,

121
00:05:31,225 --> 00:05:32,360
it'll become negative.

122
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,600
So you're going to take a
negative number plus 21, it'll

123
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,490
be less than 21, so your
parabola is going

124
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:38,730
to look like this.

125
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:44,160
Your parabola is going
to look like that.

126
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,330
And that's why vertex
form is useful.

127
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:52,970
You break it up into the part
of the equation that changes

128
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,000
in value, and say,
well, what's its

129
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,130
maximum value attained?

130
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:57,150
That's the vertex.

131
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,670
That happens when
x is equal to 4.

132
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,320
And you know its y value.

133
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,800
And because you have a negative
coefficient out here

134
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,710
that's a negative 3, you know
that it's going to be a

135
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:06,980
downward opening graph.

136
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,560
If that was a positive 3, then
this thing would be, at

137
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,160
minimum, 0 and it would be
an upward opening graph.

138
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:13,466
