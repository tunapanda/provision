1
00:00:00,548 --> 00:00:02,298
In my humble opinion,

2
00:00:02,298 --> 00:00:06,159
the single most important biochemical reaction,

3
00:00:06,159 --> 00:00:13,396
especially to us, is cellular respiration.

4
00:00:13,396 --> 00:00:17,340
And the reason why I feel so strongly about that

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:23,351
is because this is how we derive energy from what we eat, or from our fuel.

6
00:00:23,367 --> 00:00:25,726
Or if we want to be specific, from glucose.

7
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:27,103
At the end of the day, most of what we eat,

8
00:00:27,103 --> 00:00:29,530
or at least carbohydrates, end up as glucose.

9
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,390
In future videos I'll talk about how we derive energy

10
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:33,809
from fats or proteins.

11
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:40,307
But cellular respiration, let's us go from glucose to

12
00:00:40,307 --> 00:00:43,710
energy and some other byproducts.

13
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,415
And to be a little bit more specific about it,

14
00:00:45,415 --> 00:00:47,888
let me write the chemical reaction right here.

15
00:00:47,888 --> 00:00:51,654
So the chemical formula for glucose,

16
00:00:51,654 --> 00:00:57,724
you can have 6 carbons, 12 hydrogens and 6 oxygens.

17
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:00,424
So that's your glucose right there.

18
00:01:00,424 --> 00:01:03,317
So if you had one mole of glucose-- let me write that,

19
00:01:03,317 --> 00:01:05,861
that's your glucose right there--

20
00:01:05,861 --> 00:01:08,115
and then to that one mole of glucose,

21
00:01:08,115 --> 00:01:11,829
if you had six moles of molecular oxygen

22
00:01:11,829 --> 00:01:15,574
running around the cell, then

23
00:01:15,574 --> 00:01:19,292
and this is kind of a gross simplification for cellular respiration.

24
00:01:19,292 --> 00:01:20,409
I think you're going to appreciate

25
00:01:20,409 --> 00:01:22,202
over the course of the next few videos,

26
00:01:22,202 --> 00:01:26,426
that one can get as involved into this mechanism as possible.

27
00:01:26,426 --> 00:01:28,025
But I think it's nice to get the big picture.

28
00:01:28,025 --> 00:01:31,491
But if you give me some glucose, if you have one mole of glucose

29
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:36,113
and six moles of oxygen, through the process of cellular respiration

30
00:01:36,113 --> 00:01:39,521
and so I'm just writing it as kind of a big black box right now

31
00:01:39,521 --> 00:01:40,737
let me pick a nice color.

32
00:01:40,737 --> 00:01:45,786
So this is cellular respiration.

33
00:01:45,786 --> 00:01:47,532
Which we'll see is quite involved.

34
00:01:47,532 --> 00:01:48,991
But I guess anything can be,

35
00:01:48,991 --> 00:01:51,047
if you want to be particular enough about it.

36
00:01:51,047 --> 00:01:52,206
Through cellular respiration,

37
00:01:52,206 --> 00:01:58,151
we're going to produce six moles of carbon dioxide.

38
00:01:58,151 --> 00:02:01,922
Six moles of water.

39
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:05,422
And-- this is the super-important part

40
00:02:05,422 --> 00:02:08,899
-- we're going to produce energy.

41
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:10,419
We're going to produce energy.

42
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:14,657
And this is the energy that can be used to do useful work,

43
00:02:14,657 --> 00:02:17,598
to heat our bodies,

44
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:20,470
to provide electrical impulses in our brains.

45
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:23,503
Whatever energy, especially a human body needs,

46
00:02:23,503 --> 00:02:25,053
but it's not just humans,

47
00:02:25,053 --> 00:02:28,942
is provided by this cellular respiration mechanism.

48
00:02:28,942 --> 00:02:30,747
And when you say energy, you might say, hey Sal,

49
00:02:30,747 --> 00:02:32,725
in the last video didn't you just

50
00:02:32,725 --> 00:02:34,743
--well, if that was the last video you watched

51
00:02:34,743 --> 00:02:36,748
you probably saw that I said

52
00:02:36,748 --> 00:02:47,713
ATP is the energy currency for biological systems.

53
00:02:47,713 --> 00:02:49,501
And so you might say hey, well it looks like

54
00:02:49,501 --> 00:02:52,222
glucose is the energy currency for biological systems.

55
00:02:52,222 --> 00:02:54,103
And to some degree,

56
00:02:54,103 --> 00:02:57,244
both answers would be correct.

57
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:59,282
But to just see how it fits together

58
00:02:59,282 --> 00:03:02,089
is that the process of cellular respiration,

59
00:03:02,089 --> 00:03:04,318
it does produce energy directly.

60
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:08,455
But that energy is used to produce ATP.

61
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:11,402
So if I were to break down this energy portion of

62
00:03:11,402 --> 00:03:13,444
cellular respiration right there,

63
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:15,297
some of it would just be heat.

64
00:03:15,297 --> 00:03:17,145
You know, it just warms up the cell.

65
00:03:17,145 --> 00:03:19,066
And then some of it is used

66
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:21,085
--and this is what the textbooks will tell you.

67
00:03:21,085 --> 00:03:25,339
The textbooks will say it produces 38 ATPs.

68
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:28,608
It can be more readily used by cells to contract muscles

69
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:32,444
or to generate nerve impulses or do whatever else

70
00:03:32,444 --> 00:03:35,881
grow, or divide, or whatever else the cell might need.

71
00:03:35,881 --> 00:03:37,320
So really, cellular respiration,

72
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,847
to say it produces energy, a little disingenuous.

73
00:03:39,847 --> 00:03:42,089
It's really the process of taking glucose

74
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:45,187
and producing ATPs, with maybe heat as a byproduct.

75
00:03:45,187 --> 00:03:47,091
But it's probably nice to have that heat around.

76
00:03:47,091 --> 00:03:49,547
We need to be reasonably warm

77
00:03:49,547 --> 00:03:51,689
in order for our cells to operate correctly.

78
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:55,341
So the whole point is really to go from glucose,

79
00:03:55,341 --> 00:03:56,503
from one mole of glucose

80
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:58,099
-- and the textbooks will tell you

81
00:03:58,099 --> 00:04:01,241
-- to 38 ATPs.

82
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:05,853
And the reality is, this is in the ideal circumstances

83
00:04:05,853 --> 00:04:08,265
that you'll produce 38 ATPs.

84
00:04:08,265 --> 00:04:10,450
I was reading up a little bit before doing this video.

85
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,807
And the reality is, depending on the efficiency of the cell

86
00:04:13,807 --> 00:04:16,383
in performing cellular respiration,

87
00:04:16,383 --> 00:04:20,688
it'll probably be more on the order of 29 to 30 ATPs.

88
00:04:20,688 --> 00:04:22,237
But there's a huge variation here

89
00:04:22,237 --> 00:04:25,960
and people are really still studying this idea.

90
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,098
But this is all cellular respiration is.

91
00:04:28,098 --> 00:04:30,095
In the next few videos we're going to break it down

92
00:04:30,095 --> 00:04:31,972
into its kind of constituent parts.

93
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:33,473
And I'm going to introduce them to you right now,

94
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:37,107
just so you realize that these are parts of cellular respiration.

95
00:04:37,107 --> 00:04:43,286
The first stage is called glycolysis.

96
00:04:43,286 --> 00:04:46,119
Which literally means breaking up glucose.

97
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:54,689
And just so you know, this part, the glyco for glucose

98
00:04:54,689 --> 00:04:57,025
and then lysis means to break up.

99
00:04:57,025 --> 00:04:58,081
When you saw hydrolysis,

100
00:04:58,081 --> 00:05:00,362
it means using water to break up a molecule.

101
00:05:00,362 --> 00:05:04,051
Glycolysis means we're going to be breaking up glucose.

102
00:05:04,051 --> 00:05:07,107
And in case you care about things like word origins,

103
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:11,696
glucose comes from, the gluc part of glucose

104
00:05:11,696 --> 00:05:14,448
comes from Greek for sweet.

105
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:16,559
And glucose is indeed sweet.

106
00:05:16,559 --> 00:05:20,954
And then all sugars, we put this ose ending.

107
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:23,423
So that just means sugar.

108
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:25,392
So you might think it's kind of a redundant statement

109
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:26,292
to say sweet sugar.

110
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:27,758
But there are some sugars that aren't sweet.

111
00:05:27,758 --> 00:05:30,297
For example, lactose, Milk,

112
00:05:30,297 --> 00:05:32,928
it might be a little bit, but when you actually

113
00:05:32,928 --> 00:05:36,596
digest lactose then you can turn it into an actual sweet sugar

114
00:05:36,596 --> 00:05:39,439
but it doesn't taste sweet like glucose or fructose

115
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,675
or sucrose would taste.

116
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:44,948
But anyway, that's an aside.

117
00:05:44,948 --> 00:05:47,681
But the first step of cellular respiration is glycolysis

118
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,396
breaking up of glucose.

119
00:05:49,396 --> 00:05:52,886
What it does is, it breaks up the glucose molecule

120
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:56,152
from a 6-carbon molecule

121
00:05:56,152 --> 00:05:58,704
-- so it literally takes it from a 6-carbon

122
00:05:58,704 --> 00:06:01,323
-- let me draw it like this

123
00:06:01,323 --> 00:06:03,707
-- a 6-carbon molecule that looks like this.

124
00:06:03,707 --> 00:06:04,567
And it's actually a cycle.

125
00:06:04,567 --> 00:06:08,440
Let me show you what glucose actually looks like.

126
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,304
This is glucose right here.

127
00:06:10,304 --> 00:06:14,074
And notice you have one, two, three,

128
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:16,193
four, five, six carbons.

129
00:06:16,193 --> 00:06:18,145
I got this off of Wikipedia.

130
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:20,681
Just look up glucose and you can see this diagram

131
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:22,943
if you want to kind of see the details.

132
00:06:22,943 --> 00:06:26,194
You can see you have six carbons, six oxygens.

133
00:06:26,194 --> 00:06:28,589
That's one, two, three, four, five, six.

134
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:30,524
And then all these little small blue things

135
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:32,185
are my hydrogens.

136
00:06:32,185 --> 00:06:34,428
So that's what glucose actually looks like.

137
00:06:34,428 --> 00:06:37,433
But the process of glycolysis, you're essentially just taking--

138
00:06:37,433 --> 00:06:39,925
I'm writing it out as a string,

139
00:06:39,925 --> 00:06:41,820
but you could imagine it as a chain

140
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,406
-- and it has oxygens and hydrogens added to it,

141
00:06:44,406 --> 00:06:46,039
to each of these carbons.

142
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:48,041
But it has a carbon backbone.

143
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:53,862
And it breaks that carbon backbone into two.

144
00:06:53,862 --> 00:06:57,616
That's what glycolysis does, right there.

145
00:06:57,616 --> 00:07:00,037
So you've kind of lysed the glucose

146
00:07:00,037 --> 00:07:01,798
and each of these things.

147
00:07:01,798 --> 00:07:03,070
And I haven't drawn all the other stuff

148
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,625
that's added on to that.

149
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,436
You know, these things are all bonded to other things,

150
00:07:06,436 --> 00:07:08,448
with oxygens and hydrogens and whatever.

151
00:07:08,448 --> 00:07:10,946
But each of these 3-carbon backbone molecules

152
00:07:10,946 --> 00:07:12,249
are called pyruvate.

153
00:07:12,249 --> 00:07:13,719
We'll go into a lot more detail on that.

154
00:07:13,719 --> 00:07:19,794
But glycolysis, it by itself generates--

155
00:07:19,794 --> 00:07:26,309
well, it needs two ATPs.

156
00:07:26,309 --> 00:07:32,414
And it generates four ATPs.

157
00:07:32,414 --> 00:07:38,113
So on a net basis, it generates two

158
00:07:38,113 --> 00:07:39,718
-- let me write this in a different color

159
00:07:39,718 --> 00:07:46,954
--it generates two net ATPs.

160
00:07:46,954 --> 00:07:48,569
So that's the first stage.

161
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:51,638
And this can occur completely in the absence of oxygen.

162
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:54,059
I'll do a whole video on glycolysis in the future.

163
00:07:54,059 --> 00:07:55,583
Then these byproducts,

164
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,027
they get re-engineered a little bit.

165
00:07:57,027 --> 00:08:06,172
And then they enter into what's called the Krebs cycle.

166
00:08:06,179 --> 00:08:10,424
Which generates another two ATPs.

167
00:08:10,424 --> 00:08:12,830
And then, and this is kind of the interesting point,

168
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:15,239
there's another process that you can say

169
00:08:15,239 --> 00:08:16,601
happens after the Krebs cycle.

170
00:08:16,601 --> 00:08:18,809
But we're in a cell and everything's bumping into everything

171
00:08:18,809 --> 00:08:19,912
all of the time.

172
00:08:19,912 --> 00:08:23,251
But it's normally viewed to be after glycolysis

173
00:08:23,251 --> 00:08:24,526
and the Krebs cycle.

174
00:08:24,526 --> 00:08:31,581
And this requires oxygen.

175
00:08:31,581 --> 00:08:34,316
So let me be clear, glycolysis, this first step,

176
00:08:34,316 --> 00:08:37,337
no oxygen required.

177
00:08:37,337 --> 00:08:41,042
Doesn't need oxygen.

178
00:08:41,042 --> 00:08:42,572
It can occur with oxygen or without it.

179
00:08:42,572 --> 00:08:47,509
Oxygen not needed.

180
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:50,275
Or you could say this is called an anaerobic process.

181
00:08:50,275 --> 00:08:52,906
This is the anaerobic part of the respiration.

182
00:08:52,906 --> 00:08:55,873
Let me write that down too. Anaerobic.

183
00:08:55,873 --> 00:08:57,306
Maybe I'll write that down here.

184
00:08:57,306 --> 00:09:02,771
Glycolysis, since it doesn't need oxygen,

185
00:09:02,771 --> 00:09:05,521
we can say it's anaerobic.

186
00:09:05,521 --> 00:09:09,217
You might be familiar with the idea of aerobic exercise.

187
00:09:09,217 --> 00:09:11,076
The whole idea of aerobic exercise is

188
00:09:11,076 --> 00:09:12,437
to make you breathe hard

189
00:09:12,437 --> 00:09:15,477
because you need a lot of oxygen to do aerobic exercise.

190
00:09:15,477 --> 00:09:18,201
So anaerobic means you don't need oxygen.

191
00:09:18,201 --> 00:09:20,019
Aerobic means it needs oxygen.

192
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:21,142
Anaerobic means the opposite.

193
00:09:21,142 --> 00:09:22,602
You don't need oxygen.

194
00:09:22,602 --> 00:09:24,440
So, glycolysis anaerobic.

195
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:29,152
And it produces two ATPs net.

196
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:34,750
And then you go to the Krebs cycle,

197
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,545
there's a little bit of setup involved here.

198
00:09:36,545 --> 00:09:38,868
And we'll do the detail of that in the future.

199
00:09:38,868 --> 00:09:43,217
But then you move over to the Krebs cycle, which is aerobic.

200
00:09:43,217 --> 00:09:45,586
It is aerobic.

201
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:48,672
It requires oxygen to be around.

202
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:52,016
And then this produces two ATPs.

203
00:09:52,016 --> 00:09:53,497
And then this is the part that, frankly,

204
00:09:53,497 --> 00:09:55,075
when I first learned it, confused me a lot.

205
00:09:55,075 --> 00:09:57,009
But I'll just write it in order

206
00:09:57,009 --> 00:09:58,092
the way it's traditionally written.

207
00:09:58,092 --> 00:09:59,644
Then you have something called

208
00:09:59,644 --> 00:10:03,347
--we're using the same colors too much

209
00:10:03,347 --> 00:10:04,601
-- you have something called

210
00:10:04,601 --> 00:10:11,170
the electron transport chain.

211
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:13,518
And this part gets credit

212
00:10:13,518 --> 00:10:16,817
for producing the bulk of the ATPs.

213
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:19,385
34 ATPs.

214
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:22,890
And this is also aerobic.

215
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:24,888
It requires oxygen. So you can see,

216
00:10:24,888 --> 00:10:25,756
if you had no oxygen,

217
00:10:25,756 --> 00:10:27,791
if the cells weren't getting enough oxygen,

218
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:30,816
you can produce a little bit of energy.

219
00:10:30,816 --> 00:10:34,401
But it's nowhere near as much as you can produce

220
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:36,370
once you have the oxygen.

221
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,843
And actually when you start running out of oxygen,

222
00:10:38,843 --> 00:10:41,913
this can't proceed forward, so what happens is

223
00:10:41,913 --> 00:10:44,744
some of these byproducts of glycolysis,

224
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:46,444
instead of going into the Krebs cycle

225
00:10:46,444 --> 00:10:48,070
and the electron transport chain,

226
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:50,319
where they need oxygen, instead,

227
00:10:50,319 --> 00:10:55,587
they go through a side process called fermentation.

228
00:10:55,587 --> 00:10:58,420
For some organisms, this process of fermentation

229
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,547
takes your byproducts of glycolysis

230
00:11:00,547 --> 00:11:02,430
and literally produces alcohol.

231
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,567
That's where alcohol comes from.

232
00:11:04,567 --> 00:11:06,475
That's called alcohol fermentation.

233
00:11:06,475 --> 00:11:09,703
And we, as human beings, I guess fortunately or unfortunately,

234
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:12,606
our muscles do not directly produce alcohol.

235
00:11:12,606 --> 00:11:14,442
They produce lactic acid.

236
00:11:14,442 --> 00:11:17,544
So we do lactic acid fermentation.

237
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:18,635
Let me write that down.

238
00:11:18,635 --> 00:11:19,889
Lactic acid.

239
00:11:19,889 --> 00:11:24,084
That's humans and probably other mammals.

240
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:34,738
But other things like yeast will do alcohol fermentation.

241
00:11:34,738 --> 00:11:36,187
So this is when you don't have oxygen.

242
00:11:36,187 --> 00:11:37,485
It's actually this lactic acid that

243
00:11:37,485 --> 00:11:41,013
if I were to sprint really hard and not be able to get enough oxygen,

244
00:11:41,013 --> 00:11:42,337
that my muscles start to ache

245
00:11:42,337 --> 00:11:45,238
because this lactic acid starts to build up.

246
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:47,207
But that's just a side thing.

247
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,824
If we have oxygen we can move to the Krebs cycle,

248
00:11:48,824 --> 00:11:52,435
get our two ATPs, and then go on to the electron transport chain

249
00:11:52,435 --> 00:11:56,011
and produce 34 ATPs, which is really the bulk

250
00:11:56,011 --> 00:11:57,963
of what happens in respiration.

251
00:11:57,963 --> 00:11:59,539
Now I said this as an aside,

252
00:11:59,539 --> 00:12:02,222
that to some degree this isn't fair.

253
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,744
Because while these guys are operating

254
00:12:04,744 --> 00:12:06,977
they're also producing these other molecules.

255
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:08,530
They're not producing them entirely,

256
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,265
but what they're doing is, they're taking

257
00:12:10,265 --> 00:12:11,838
-- and I know this gets complicated here

258
00:12:11,838 --> 00:12:13,465
but I think over the course of the next few videos

259
00:12:13,465 --> 00:12:15,581
we'll get an intuition for it--

260
00:12:15,581 --> 00:12:17,616
in these two parts of the reaction,

261
00:12:17,616 --> 00:12:19,546
glycolysis and the Krebs cycle,

262
00:12:19,546 --> 00:12:22,178
we're constantly taking NAD

263
00:12:22,178 --> 00:12:24,307
-- I'll write it as NAD plus

264
00:12:24,307 --> 00:12:28,844
-- and we're adding hydrogens to it to form NADH.

265
00:12:28,844 --> 00:12:32,726
And this actually happens for one molecule of glucose,

266
00:12:32,726 --> 00:12:34,664
this happens to 10 NADs.

267
00:12:34,664 --> 00:12:37,991
Or 10 NAD plusses to become NADHs.

268
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:41,159
And those are actually what drive the electron transport chain.

269
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:44,404
And I'll talk a lot more about it and kind of how that happens

270
00:12:44,404 --> 00:12:46,663
and why is energy being derived

271
00:12:46,663 --> 00:12:49,907
and how is this an oxidative reaction and all of that.

272
00:12:49,907 --> 00:12:51,582
And what's getting oxidized and what's being reduced.

273
00:12:51,582 --> 00:12:53,157
But I just wanted to give due credit.

274
00:12:53,157 --> 00:12:55,367
These guys aren't just producing two ATPs

275
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:56,922
in each of these stages.

276
00:12:56,922 --> 00:13:01,351
They're also producing, actually combined, 10 NADHs,

277
00:13:01,351 --> 00:13:06,138
which each produce three ATPs in an ideal situation

278
00:13:06,138 --> 00:13:08,484
the electron transport chain.

279
00:13:08,484 --> 00:13:11,556
And they're also doing it to this other molecule,

280
00:13:11,556 --> 00:13:13,722
FAD, which is very similar.

281
00:13:13,722 --> 00:13:17,501
But they're producing FADH.

282
00:13:17,501 --> 00:13:19,284
Now I know all of this is very complicated.

283
00:13:19,284 --> 00:13:21,212
I'll make videos on this in the future.

284
00:13:21,212 --> 00:13:24,805
But the important thing to remember is cellular respiration

285
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:30,639
all it is is taking glucose and kind of repackaging the energy in glucose

286
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,002
and repackaging it in the form of,

287
00:13:32,002 --> 00:13:35,020
your textbooks will tell you, 38 ATPs.

288
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,692
If you're doing an exam, that's a good number to write.

289
00:13:36,692 --> 00:13:39,673
It tends to, in reality be a smaller number.

290
00:13:39,673 --> 00:13:40,579
It's also going to produce heat.

291
00:13:40,579 --> 00:13:42,358
Actually most of it is going to be heat.

292
00:13:42,358 --> 00:13:45,592
But 38 ATPs, and it does it through three stages.

293
00:13:45,592 --> 00:13:47,478
The first stage is glycolysis,

294
00:13:47,478 --> 00:13:51,925
where you're just literally splitting the glucose into two.

295
00:13:51,925 --> 00:13:53,347
You're generating some ATPs.

296
00:13:53,347 --> 00:13:55,269
But the more important thing is,

297
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:58,101
you're generating some NADHs that are going to

298
00:13:58,101 --> 00:13:58,937
be used later in the electron transport chain.

299
00:13:58,937 --> 00:14:01,875
Then those byproducts are split even more in the Krebs cycle,

300
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:04,144
directly producing two ATPs.

301
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:06,457
But that produces a lot more NADHs.

302
00:14:06,457 --> 00:14:10,704
And all of those NADHs are used in the electron transport chain

303
00:14:10,704 --> 00:14:14,888
to produce the bulk of your energy currency,

304
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:17,658
or your 34 ATPs.
