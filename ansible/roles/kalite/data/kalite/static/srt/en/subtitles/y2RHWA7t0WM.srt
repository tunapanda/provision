1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:03,300
We're asked to sort the
following units of measurement

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:10,198
into two categories:
U.S. customary units and metric units.

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,814
So these are just two different systems. 
You'll get more and more familiar with them.

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,325
Then indicate whether each unit
measures length, weight, mass, or volume.

5
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:23,631
Let's do the first. Let's see which of these are U.S. customary unit versus metric units.

6
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:27,900
So the liter is a metric unit.

7
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,020
You would use it in
the metric system.

8
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:33,390
A gallon is a U.S.
customary unit.

9
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,700
We've been dealing with that.

10
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,090
If you fill your gasoline in
Europe, you're going to be

11
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:40,410
filling it in terms of liters.

12
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:41,730
In the U.S., you're going
to be filling

13
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,570
it in terms of gallons.

14
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:45,190
And we're going to talk about
whether they're units of

15
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:46,970
volume and whatnot
in a little bit.

16
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:53,400
Decigram, that is
metric system.

17
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:56,750
In general, whenever you see
these prefixes, deci, centi,

18
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,000
kilo, you're dealing with
the metric system.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,840
No one ever talks about
a kilopound.

20
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,010
I guess you could, but no one
really talks about it.

21
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,379
Same thing, millimeter.

22
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:05,519
This is metric system.

23
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,190
A gram is metric system.

24
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,700
Meter is metric system.

25
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,700
The foot is a U.S.
customary unit.

26
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,380
We'll talk about whether it's
distance or any of that in a little bit.

27
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:20,530
Kilogram, once again,
it is metric units.

28
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,750
In case you haven't gotten what
I'm doing here, blue for

29
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:27,540
metric, red for U.S. customary
units, or I guess magenta.

30
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,720
Centiliter, that is metric.

31
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,180
Centimeter, meters are metric.

32
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,880
And notice we have the
prefix in both cases.

33
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,110
Centi means 1/100.

34
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:42,840
Cup, that is U.S.
customary units.

35
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,800
I have to do that
in the magenta.

36
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,140
Cup, U.S. customary units.

37
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,830
Meter, that is the
metric system.

38
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,530
Pound, U.S. customary units.

39
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,220
It's getting a little tedious.

40
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:01,250
Inch, same thing, that's what
we use in the U.S. Ounce, we

41
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:05,600
use that in the U.S. And then
the yard, we also use that in the U.S.

42
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,190
Now we've divided them up.

43
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:11,120
All the magenta ones are used
in the U.S. All of the blue

44
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,230
ones are used really in the
rest of the world, and

45
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,790
actually some places in
the U.S. as well.

46
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:18,260
I think a lot of the world is
frustrated that the U.S., that

47
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,450
we're not all converted to this
because the metric system

48
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:21,760
is actually a little
bit more logical.

49
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,870
It's easy to just figure out
what it's saying, and we'll

50
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,970
deal with that in more
detail in the future.

51
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:29,090
Now the next thing we to
figure out is whether

52
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:33,290
something is a measure of
length, weight/mass-- and

53
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:34,640
they're not exactly
the same thing.

54
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,580
Mass is how much of a 
substance you have.

55
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:42,552
Weight is how much force with which 
gravity is pulling on that mass.

56
00:02:42,675 --> 00:02:44,690
And it would change depending
on what planet you're on.

57
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:47,870
But on Earth, they tend to be
used interchangeably, so we'll

58
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,930
use it roughly interchangeably here.

59
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:52,772
And then you have volume, or how 
much space something takes up.

60
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,380
So this is distance.

61
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:58,000
This is moving in
one dimension.

62
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,790
Mass is how much
stuff there is.

63
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:02,540
Weight is how much the force
that stuff is pulled on, on a

64
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:05,470
planet, by gravity, or I
guess a star anywhere.

65
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:10,030
And volume is how much space
does that stuff take up.

66
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,000
Now let's think about it.

67
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,580
Liter is volume.

68
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,380
This right here is volume.

69
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,390
How much space do you take up.

70
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,860
Gallon is also volume.

71
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,390
That's in the U.S. and in
Europe, or in the metric

72
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:24,830
system, it would be a liter.

73
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,420
That's a gram.

74
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,745
Gram is a unit of mass.

75
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,110
So decigram just means
1/10 of a gram.

76
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:36,810
Millimeter.

77
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,610
Meter is a unit.

78
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:43,890
Meter right here, that is the
unit of distance or of length.

79
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:48,500
Millimeter, milli means
1/1,000 of a meter.

80
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,570
Foot, that is also
a unit of length.

81
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:56,250
Kilogram, that just
means 1,000 grams.

82
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,320
Kilo means a thousand.

83
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,800
Gram, we already said,
is a unit of mass.

84
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,900
Centiliter, that means
1/100 of a liter.

85
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,640
Liter, we already figured out,
is a unit of volume.

86
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,330
Centimeter, we already
figured out.

87
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,700
Meter is a unit of length.

88
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,650
Centimeter means 1/100
of a meter.

89
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:20,630
So this is a unit of length.

90
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:23,370
Cup, we've seen multiple
times already.

91
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:28,140
It is a unit of volume, how much 
space does something take up.

92
00:04:28,248 --> 00:04:30,390
Meter, that is length.

93
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,210
We've seen it multiple
times already.

94
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:35,281
Pound, that is actually
a unit of weight.

95
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,490
An inch is a unit of length.

96
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,950
We're all familiar with it.

97
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:48,020
An ounce-- you have to be
careful here-- if someone just

98
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,830
has an ounce, that is
1/16 of a pound.

99
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:53,330
It as a unit of weight.

100
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:56,460
If it was written fluid ounce,
then we'd be talking about

101
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,790
1/16 of a pint, and then it
would be a unit of volume.

102
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,300
But since it's just ounce,
it's a unit of

103
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,380
weight, 1/16 of a pound.

104
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:07,690
And then finally, a yard
is a unit of length.

105
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,460
And we are done.
