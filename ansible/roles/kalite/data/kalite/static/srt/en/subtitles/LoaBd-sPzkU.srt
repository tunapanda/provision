This video is on Perimeter and Area

2
00:00:07,267 --> 00:00:17,133
Perimeter on the left and Area on the right.

3
00:00:17,133 --> 00:00:21,533
Perimeter is the distance to go around something.

4
00:00:21,533 --> 00:00:25,733
If you were to put a fence around or measure something

5
00:00:25,733 --> 00:00:31,533
If you were to put a tape around a figure,

6
00:00:31,533 --> 00:00:36,400
if i have a rectangle, and the rectangle is a figure

7
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:44,867
that has 4 sides and four right angles,

8
00:00:44,867 --> 00:00:48,200
This has 4 right angles and 4 sides and the

9
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:55,867
opposite sides are equal in length.

10
00:00:55,867 --> 00:01:02,867
I will label the points ABCD, let us say we

11
00:01:02,867 --> 00:01:13,533
know the following AB = 7, and BC = 5

12
00:01:13,533 --> 00:01:23,733
We want to know what is the perimeter of ABCD

13
00:01:23,733 --> 00:01:29,667
Perimeter of rectangle ABCD = the sum of the lengths of the sides

14
00:01:29,667 --> 00:01:33,533
If I were to build a fence on the plot of this land

15
00:01:33,533 --> 00:01:37,933
I need to measure the length of the sides,

16
00:01:37,933 --> 00:01:46,533
we know this length AB is 7, this length isBC 5,

17
00:01:46,533 --> 00:01:57,200
DC is going to be same as Ab = 7 and DA is going

18
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:06,800
to be the same length as BC = 5.

19
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,467
So we have 7+5+7+5 = 24, perimeter is 24

20
00:02:10,467 --> 00:02:23,400
We can go the other way around, lets say we have a square

21
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,800
A square has 4 sides and 4 right angles and

22
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:44,467
all sides are equal. let me draw a square, this is ABCD

23
00:02:44,467 --> 00:02:58,400
and this square has a perimeter of 36

24
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,600
Given that what is the length of each side.

25
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,800
All sides are of equal length, let us call x as the length of a side

26
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:16,733
AB = x, BC=x, CD = x, DA = x

27
00:03:16,733 --> 00:03:20,533
If we want to figure the perimeter it will be x+x+x+x

28
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:31,600
x+x+x+x = 4x = 36

29
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,200
To solve this 4 times something = 36

30
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:43,200
divide both sides by 4, we get x = 9

31
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:53,800
This is a 9 by 9 square.That is perimeter

32
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:59,667
Area is a measure of how much space this thing take

33
00:03:59,667 --> 00:04:06,267
One way to think is if I have a 1 by 1 square,

34
00:04:06,267 --> 00:04:13,800
for a rectangle you need to specify 2 dimensions as

35
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,733
the other sides will be the same, for rectangle we

36
00:04:16,733 --> 00:04:23,333
say it is a 5 by 7 rectangle.

37
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:36,400
If one side is 1 in a square, all sides are 1

38
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:43,933
Area of any figure is how many 1by 1 square can you fit on that figure

39
00:04:43,933 --> 00:04:48,600
If we go back to that rectangle and I want to find the area

40
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,533
of this rectangle and the notation to be used is

41
00:04:52,533 --> 00:05:01,333
put it in brackets area of rectangle ABCD =<ABCD>

42
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:06,000
it is the number of 1 by 1 squares we can fit in this rectangle

43
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:15,400
Lets try doing it , we have 5 - 1by 1 squares this way

44
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:32,733
and 7 - 1by 1 squares this way,

45
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:40,600
Going along one of the sides we can put 7 , over here

46
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:56,400
we can put 5 rows, this is 1 each and adds upto 5

47
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,667
and this is 1 each adds upto 7

48
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:11,867
We can actually count the number of 1 by 1 squares

49
00:06:11,867 --> 00:06:23,533
we have 5 rows and 7 columns, we have 35 squares

50
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:28,067
So the area of this figure is 35 .

51
00:06:28,067 --> 00:06:31,333
So the general method is take one dimension and

52
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:33,933
multiply by the other dimension

53
00:06:33,933 --> 00:06:44,867
If i have a rectangle of dimension 1/2 by 2,

54
00:06:44,867 --> 00:06:51,000
we can just multiply these two 1/2 * 2 = 1

55
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:10,333
In this dimension i can only fit half a square

56
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:14,333
When we add 2 halves, we get 1

57
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:17,200
Now what about area of the square.

58
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,200
Square is a special case where length and width are the same

59
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:32,867
So if have a square and lets call it XYZS,

60
00:07:32,867 --> 00:07:38,867
i want to find the area and i know XS = 2, i want to

61
00:07:38,867 --> 00:07:48,867
find the area of XYZS = < XYZS>

62
00:07:48,867 --> 00:07:52,267
We know all the sides are equal,

63
00:07:52,267 --> 00:07:56,600
It is a special case of a rectangle, we know if this is 2

64
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,867
this also is 2 So we just multiple 2 by 2 = 2 * 2 = 4

65
00:08:00,867 --> 00:08:21,200
And you can see you can fit 4 - 1 by 1 squares in this
