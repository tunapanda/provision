00:00:00,841 --> 00:00:04,724
Welcome to the presentation on BASIC ADDITION.

2
00:00:04,724 --> 00:00:05,690
I know what you're thinking:

3
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:08,208
"Sal, addition doesn't seem so basic to me."

4
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:09,403
Well, I apologize.

5
00:00:09,419 --> 00:00:10,838
I hope I --

6
00:00:10,838 --> 00:00:12,606
Hopefully, by the end of this presentation,

7
00:00:12,606 --> 00:00:14,942
or in a couple of weeks, it will seem basic.

8
00:00:14,942 --> 00:00:16,862
So lets get started with,

9
00:00:16,862 --> 00:00:18,623
I guess we could say, some problems.

10
00:00:18,623 --> 00:00:22,013
Well, let's say I start with an old classic.

11
00:00:22,013 --> 00:00:26,192
1 + 1

12
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:28,468
And I think you already know how to do this.

13
00:00:28,468 --> 00:00:30,962
But, I'll kind of show you a way of doing this,

14
00:00:30,962 --> 00:00:32,492
in case you don't have this memorized,

15
00:00:32,492 --> 00:00:34,412
or you haven't already mastered this.

16
00:00:34,412 --> 00:00:36,595
You say, well, if I have

17
00:00:36,595 --> 00:00:39,199
one

18
00:00:39,199 --> 00:00:41,099
(Let's call that an avocado.)

19
00:00:41,099 --> 00:00:42,771
If I have 1 avocado,

20
00:00:42,771 --> 00:00:46,765
and then you were to give me another avocado,

21
00:00:46,765 --> 00:00:49,041
how many avocados do I now have?

22
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:51,548
Well, let's see. I have 1 ... 2 avocados.

23
00:00:51,548 --> 00:00:54,940
So 1 + 1 is equal to 2.

24
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,377
Now, I know what you are thinking:

25
00:00:56,377 --> 00:00:57,850
"That was too easy."

26
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,030
So, let me give you something a little bit more difficult.

27
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,669
I like the avocados. I might stick with that theme.

28
00:01:03,669 --> 00:01:09,010
What is 3 + 4?

29
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:12,214
Hmm. This is, I think, a more difficult problem.

30
00:01:12,214 --> 00:01:14,321
Well, let's stick with the avocados.

31
00:01:14,321 --> 00:01:16,500
And in case you don't know what an avocado is,

32
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,964
it's, it's actually a very delicious fruit.

33
00:01:18,964 --> 00:01:21,363
It's actually the fattiest of all the fruits.

34
00:01:21,363 --> 00:01:22,415
You probably didn't even think it was a fruit --

35
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:23,994
even if you [have eaten] one.

36
00:01:23,994 --> 00:01:28,050
So, let's say I have 3 avocados.

37
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:32,418
1, 2, 3. Right? 1, 2, 3.

38
00:01:32,418 --> 00:01:35,561
And let's say you were to give me 4 more avocados.

39
00:01:35,561 --> 00:01:37,746
So let me put this 4 in yellow,

40
00:01:37,746 --> 00:01:40,775
so you know that these are the ones you're giving me.

41
00:01:40,775 --> 00:01:41,894
1

42
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:43,067
2

43
00:01:43,067 --> 00:01:44,166
3

44
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:45,976
4

45
00:01:45,976 --> 00:01:48,623
So how many total avocados do I have now?

46
00:01:48,623 --> 00:01:55,500
That's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 avocados.

47
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,468
So 3 + 4 is equal to 7.

48
00:01:59,068 --> 00:02:00,252
And now I am going to introduce you

49
00:02:00,252 --> 00:02:01,755
to another way of thinking about this.

50
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:03,135
It's called the number line.

51
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:05,299
And, actually, I think this is how I do it in my head,

52
00:02:05,315 --> 00:02:08,267
when I forget -- if I don't have it memorized.

53
00:02:08,267 --> 00:02:11,657
So [on the] number line, I just write all the numbers in order,

54
00:02:11,657 --> 00:02:13,610
and I go high enough just so I can --

55
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,766
[so that] all the numbers I am using are, kind of, in it.

56
00:02:15,766 --> 00:02:17,364
So, you know the first number is 0,

57
00:02:17,364 --> 00:02:18,040
which is nothing.

58
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,083
Maybe you don't know; but now you know.

59
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,094
And then you go to

60
00:02:21,094 --> 00:02:22,133
1 (one)

61
00:02:22,133 --> 00:02:23,523
2 (two)

62
00:02:23,523 --> 00:02:25,018
3 (three)

63
00:02:26,203 --> 00:02:27,562
4 (four)

64
00:02:27,562 --> 00:02:29,137
5 (five)

65
00:02:29,137 --> 00:02:30,468
6 (six)

66
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:31,769
7 (seven)

67
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:33,446
8 (eight)

68
00:02:33,446 --> 00:02:34,924
9 (nine)

69
00:02:34,924 --> 00:02:36,363
10 (ten)

70
00:02:36,363 --> 00:02:37,346
It keeps going,

71
00:02:37,346 --> 00:02:37,952
11 (eleven)

72
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:41,750
So, we're sayng 3 + 4. So let's start at 3.

73
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,701
So I have 3 here.

74
00:02:43,701 --> 00:02:45,654
And we're going to add 4 to that 3.

75
00:02:45,654 --> 00:02:48,259
So all we do is we go up the number line,

76
00:02:48,275 --> 00:02:51,088
or we go to the right on the number line, 4 more.

77
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:59,162
So we go 1 ... 2 ... 3 ... 4.

78
00:02:59,162 --> 00:02:59,960
Notice, all we did

79
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,713
is we just increased it by 1, by 2, by 3, by 4.

80
00:03:02,713 --> 00:03:04,254
And then we ended up at 7.

81
00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:06,106
And that was our answer.

82
00:03:06,106 --> 00:03:07,148
We could do a couple of different ones.

83
00:03:07,148 --> 00:03:09,762
We could say, what is --

84
00:03:09,762 --> 00:03:12,655
What if I asked you what 8 + 1 is?

85
00:03:12,655 --> 00:03:14,185
Hmmm. 8 + 1.

86
00:03:14,185 --> 00:03:15,315
Well, you might already know it.

87
00:03:15,315 --> 00:03:16,438
8 + 1 is just the next number [after 8].

88
00:03:16,438 --> 00:03:20,056
But if you look at the number line, you start at 8,

89
00:03:20,056 --> 00:03:22,451
and you add 1.

90
00:03:22,451 --> 00:03:24,661
8 + 1 is equal to 9.

91
00:03:25,553 --> 00:03:28,400
Let's do some harder problems.

92
00:03:30,246 --> 00:03:31,427
And, just so you know,

93
00:03:31,427 --> 00:03:33,518
if you're a little daunted by this initially,

94
00:03:33,518 --> 00:03:34,498
you can always draw the circles,

95
00:03:34,498 --> 00:03:36,110
you can always do the number line,

96
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:39,062
and, eventually over time, the more practice you do,

97
00:03:39,062 --> 00:03:40,717
you'll hopefully memorize these,

98
00:03:40,717 --> 00:03:42,446
and you'll do these problems in, like, half a second.

99
00:03:42,446 --> 00:03:45,438
I promise you. You've just got to keep practicing.

100
00:03:45,438 --> 00:03:46,769
Let's say....

101
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:47,679
I want to draw the number line again.

102
00:03:47,679 --> 00:03:48,947
Actually, I have a line tool;

103
00:03:48,947 --> 00:03:50,773
so I shouldn't give you all of those ugly looking lines

104
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:52,091
that I've been giving you.

105
00:03:52,168 --> 00:03:54,866
Look at that. Look at that. That's amazing.

106
00:03:54,866 --> 00:03:55,644
Alright, let me see.

107
00:03:55,644 --> 00:03:57,967
Oh. Oh. Yeah, look at that.

108
00:03:57,967 --> 00:04:01,133
Okay. So, that's a nice looking line.

109
00:04:01,133 --> 00:04:04,602
I'm gonna feel bad to erase it later on.

110
00:04:04,602 --> 00:04:06,852
So let me draw a number line.

111
00:04:06,852 --> 00:04:07,844
0

112
00:04:07,844 --> 00:04:08,975
1

113
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,167
2

114
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:11,221
3

115
00:04:11,221 --> 00:04:12,490
4

116
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,631
5

117
00:04:13,631 --> 00:04:15,346
6

118
00:04:15,346 --> 00:04:16,601
7

119
00:04:16,601 --> 00:04:17,852
8

120
00:04:17,852 --> 00:04:19,365
9

121
00:04:19,365 --> 00:04:21,146
10

122
00:04:21,162 --> 00:04:22,408
11

123
00:04:22,408 --> 00:04:23,659
12

124
00:04:23,659 --> 00:04:24,898
13

125
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:26,230
14

126
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,582
15

127
00:04:28,582 --> 00:04:30,905
So let's do a hard problem.

128
00:04:30,905 --> 00:04:33,224
What is --

129
00:04:33,224 --> 00:04:35,400
I'm gonna do it in different colors now.

130
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,825
5 + 6

131
00:04:38,825 --> 00:04:40,685
So if you want, you can pause the video and try this.

132
00:04:40,685 --> 00:04:42,202
You might already know the answer.

133
00:04:42,202 --> 00:04:44,802
And the reason why I say this is a hard problem

134
00:04:44,802 --> 00:04:47,300
is because the answer [is] more [than the]

135
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,592
[number of fingers you have on your two hands].

136
00:04:48,592 --> 00:04:50,948
So you can't necessarily do it on your fingers.

137
00:04:50,948 --> 00:04:54,218
So let's get started with this problem.

138
00:04:54,218 --> 00:04:55,230
Actually, my phone is ringing.

139
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,579
But I'm going to ignore the phone,

140
00:04:56,579 --> 00:04:58,172
because you're more important.

141
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:01,201
So. Okay. Let's start start at the 5.

142
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:03,829
So we start at the 5.

143
00:05:03,829 --> 00:05:05,577
And we're gonna add 6 to it.

144
00:05:05,577 --> 00:05:07,590
So we go: 1

145
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:08,610
2

146
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:09,864
3

147
00:05:09,864 --> 00:05:11,100
4

148
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,500
5

149
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,259
6

150
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:16,674
We're at 11!

151
00:05:16,674 --> 00:05:19,307
So 5 + 6 is equal to 11.

152
00:05:19,307 --> 00:05:21,197
Now I'm gonna ask you a question.

153
00:05:21,197 --> 00:05:24,500
What is 6 + 5?

154
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,869
Huh...

155
00:05:25,869 --> 00:05:28,659
Well, we're now going to see that, OK?

156
00:05:28,659 --> 00:05:29,977
Can you switch the two numbers

157
00:05:29,977 --> 00:05:31,105
and get the same answer?

158
00:05:31,105 --> 00:05:32,159
Well, let's try that.

159
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:33,564
I'm gonna try it in a different color,

160
00:05:33,564 --> 00:05:34,599
so we don't get all confused.

161
00:05:34,599 --> 00:05:36,254
So let's start at 6.

162
00:05:36,254 --> 00:05:39,987
Right? Ignore the yellow for now and add 5 to it.

163
00:05:39,987 --> 00:05:44,854
1 ... 2 ... 3 ... 4 ... 5.

164
00:05:44,854 --> 00:05:47,017
Ah. We get to the same place.

165
00:05:47,017 --> 00:05:48,538
And I think you might want to try this

166
00:05:48,538 --> 00:05:49,185
on a bunch of problems.

167
00:05:49,185 --> 00:05:50,777
And you'll see it always works out --

168
00:05:50,777 --> 00:05:53,300
that it doesn't matter in what order you --

169
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,069
"5 + 6" is the same thing as "6 + 5."

170
00:05:56,069 --> 00:05:57,180
And that makes sense.

171
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,005
If I have 5 avocados and you give me 6,

172
00:05:59,005 --> 00:06:00,031
I'm gonna have 11.

173
00:06:00,031 --> 00:06:01,785
If I have 6 avocados and you gave me 5,

174
00:06:01,785 --> 00:06:04,238
I'm gonna have 11 -- either way.

175
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:05,527
Let's do a couple of --

176
00:06:05,527 --> 00:06:06,570
Since this number line is so nice,

177
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,088
I wanna do a few more problems using it.

178
00:06:08,088 --> 00:06:09,174
Although, as I use it,

179
00:06:09,174 --> 00:06:11,214
I'm sure I'll just continue to confuse you,

180
00:06:11,214 --> 00:06:13,256
'cause I'll write so much on top of it. But --

181
00:06:13,256 --> 00:06:16,015
Let's see. I'll use white now.

182
00:06:16,015 --> 00:06:22,507
What is -- What is 8 + 7?

183
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:26,631
Well, if you can still read this, 8 is right here.

184
00:06:26,631 --> 00:06:28,900
Right? We're gonna add 7 to it.

185
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:36,600
1 ... 2 ... 3 ... 4 ... 5 ... 6 ... 7.

186
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,007
We go to 15.

187
00:06:39,007 --> 00:06:42,465
8 + 7 is 15.

188
00:06:42,465 --> 00:06:44,877
So hopefully, that gives you a sense

189
00:06:44,877 --> 00:06:46,400
of how to do these types of problems.

190
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,903
And more than, I guess this --

191
00:06:48,903 --> 00:06:51,200
and you're gonna learn multiplication in a little bit.

192
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,673
But these types of problems are,

193
00:06:53,673 --> 00:06:55,424
when you're getting started off in mathematics,

194
00:06:55,424 --> 00:06:56,931
these kind of require the most practice.

195
00:06:56,931 --> 00:06:59,417
And, to some degree, you have to start memorizing them.

196
00:06:59,417 --> 00:07:02,300
But, over time, you know, when you look back,

197
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,937
I want you to remember how you feel

198
00:07:03,937 --> 00:07:05,777
while you are watching this video right now.

199
00:07:05,777 --> 00:07:09,616
And then I want you to watch this video in, like, three years.

200
00:07:09,616 --> 00:07:12,309
And remember how you felt when you're watching it now.

201
00:07:12,309 --> 00:07:14,120
And you're going to be, "O my! This was so easy!"

202
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,177
'Cause you're gonna learn so fast.

203
00:07:16,177 --> 00:07:19,615
So, anyway, I think you have an idea.

204
00:07:19,615 --> 00:07:21,377
If you don't know the answer

205
00:07:21,377 --> 00:07:22,625
to any of the addition problems,

206
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:23,869
that we give you in the exercises,

207
00:07:23,869 --> 00:07:26,438
you can press the "Hints," and it'll draw circles,

208
00:07:26,438 --> 00:07:28,582
and then you can just count up the circles.

209
00:07:28,582 --> 00:07:29,763
Or, if you want to do it on your own,

210
00:07:29,763 --> 00:07:31,208
so you get the problem right,

211
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:32,584
you could draw the circles,

212
00:07:32,584 --> 00:07:34,215
or you could draw a number line, --

213
00:07:34,215 --> 00:07:36,805
like we did in this presentation.

214
00:07:36,805 --> 00:07:40,405
I think you might be ready to tackle the addition problems.

215
00:07:40,754 --> 00:07:42,377
Have fun!
