1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,560
   

2
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,610
Let's do some examples dealing
with equations of lines in

3
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:06,080
standard form.

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,980
So, so far we've had two
other forms. We've had

5
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:15,470
slope-intercept, which
is of the form, y is

6
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:18,630
equal to mx plus b.

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:19,920
That's actually this
right here.

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,020
This is in slope-intercept
form.

9
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:28,540
We've seen point-slope form
in the last video.

10
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:34,190
That's of the form, y minus some
y-value on the line being

11
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:37,960
equal to the slope times x
minus some x-value on the

12
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,670
line, when you have
that y-value.

13
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:43,830
So the point x1, y1
is on the line.

14
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,820
This right here is an example
of point-slope form.

15
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,180
And now we're going to talk
about the standard form.

16
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:54,790
And the standard form-- let me
write it here-- standard form

17
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:57,680
is essentially putting all of
the x and y terms onto the

18
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,170
left-hand side of
the equation.

19
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:05,570
So you get ax plus
by is equal to c.

20
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:10,510
I want to really emphasize that
all of these are just

21
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:14,190
different ways of writing
the same equation.

22
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,655
If you're given this, you can
out algebraically manipulate

23
00:01:16,655 --> 00:01:18,510
it to get to that or to that.

24
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:21,080
If you're given that, you
can get to that or that.

25
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,590
These are all different ways
of writing the exact same

26
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:27,110
relationship, the
exact same line.

27
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:29,170
So let's do a couple of
examples of this.

28
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:31,380
So here we have a
line right here.

29
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,290
We have an equation written
in slope-intercept form.

30
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,250
The slope is 3, the y-intercept
is negative 8.

31
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,340
Let's put it into
standard form.

32
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,270
So we just have to get
the 3x onto the

33
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,690
other side of the equation.

34
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:45,465
And the best way I can think of
doing that-- let me rewrite

35
00:01:45,465 --> 00:01:51,560
the equation, y is equal to 3x
minus 8-- let's some subtract

36
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,180
3x from both sides
of the equation.

37
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,500
So if you subtract 3x from both
sides-- so you subtract

38
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:04,380
3x, subtract 3x-- what do the
left- and right-hand sides of

39
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,600
the equation become?

40
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:14,470
The left-hand side becomes
negative 3x plus y being equal

41
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:18,560
to-- the 3x and the negative 3x
cancel out-- being equal to

42
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,150
negative 8.

43
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,050
We're done.

44
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:24,590
That's standard form
right there.

45
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:27,610
Standard form, I guess people
like it because it has both

46
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:29,680
the coefficients on the
left-hand side.

47
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,280
But it's kind of useless in
trying to figure out slope and

48
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,130
y-intercept.

49
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:35,200
I don't know what the slope and
y-intercept is when I look

50
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,100
at it in standard form.

51
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,490
My favorite is slope-intercept
form, because it tells you

52
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,790
exactly the slope and
an intercept.

53
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:45,140
Point-slope, easy to get to,
and you can look at it and

54
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,560
figure out the slope.

55
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,870
But y-intercept, you have to
do a little bit of work to

56
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:49,630
figure it out.

57
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:52,315
But at least you can just go
immediately from the slope and

58
00:02:52,315 --> 00:02:53,570
a point to it.

59
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:56,240
But anyway, let's go from this
equation, which is written in

60
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:00,360
point-slope form, and get
it to the standard form.

61
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,640
So we want to get it to the
standard form, to the same

62
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,250
type of standard form.

63
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,150
So a good thing to do, let's
just distribute things out. y

64
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:12,700
minus 7 is equal to negative 5
times x, negative 5x, plus

65
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:18,370
negative 5, times negative
12, which is positive 60.

66
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,760
Now, we want all of the variable
terms on the left,

67
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,190
all of the constant terms
on the right.

68
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:27,440
So let's add 7 to both sides
of this equation.

69
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,440
So plus 7 to both sides
of this equation.

70
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,800
What does it become?

71
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,100
Well, the minus 7 disappears,
because negative 7 plus 7.

72
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:41,920
So you're just left with
a y being equal to

73
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:49,000
negative 5x plus 67.

74
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,370
Now, if we want this x term on
the left-hand side, we could

75
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:55,010
add 5x to both sides.

76
00:03:55,010 --> 00:04:02,660
So let's add 5x to both sides
of this equation.

77
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:08,250
And we will get y plus 5x
is equal to-- these

78
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,880
cancel out-- 67.

79
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,620
Now, this is pretty much
standard form.

80
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,230
If you really want to be a
stickler for it, you can

81
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,579
rearrange these two.

82
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:21,685
So it'd be 5x plus
y is equal to 67.

83
00:04:21,685 --> 00:04:23,390
And you are done.

84
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,630
Let's do one more of these.

85
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:28,950
So this is in neither
point-slope nor in

86
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,070
slope-intercept form.

87
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,920
It's just in some type
of intermediary

88
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,470
mixed form right there.

89
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:36,080
This looks like some type of
point-slope, but this looks

90
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,060
like something different.

91
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,710
So it's really not
point-slope.

92
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,490
Let's see if we can
algebraically manipulate it to

93
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,050
the standard form.

94
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:45,570
So we get 3y plus 5.

95
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:46,780
Let's distribute out this 4.

96
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:50,950
So it's equal to 4x minus 36.

97
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,920
Let's do exactly what
we did in the last.

98
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,370
I'm using different notation on
purpose, to expose you to

99
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:56,110
different things.

100
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:59,320
So instead of doing it this way,
I'm going to subtract 5

101
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,290
from both sides, but I'm going
to do it on the same line.

102
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:05,440
So I'm going to subtract
5 from both sides.

103
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,330
And so the left-hand side of
this equation becomes 3y,

104
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:14,220
because these two guys cancel
out, and that is equal to 4x.

105
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,290
And then what is minus
36 minus 5?

106
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:21,470
That's minus 41.

107
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:24,000
And now we want the x terms
of the left-hand side.

108
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,330
So let's subtract 4x from both
sides of this equation.

109
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:33,920
So negative 4x plus,
and then minus 4x.

110
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,980
What does our equation become?

111
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:41,330
Well, the left-hand side just
stays negative 4x plus 3y.

112
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:44,400
And the right-hand, the reason
why we subtracted 4x is so it

113
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,780
cancels out with that.

114
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,800
You just have a negative 41.

115
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,990
And we're done.

116
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:52,970
We are in standard form.

117
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,460
Now, let's go the other way.

118
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:57,220
Let's start with some equations
in standard form and

119
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:00,090
figure out their slope
and y-intercept.

120
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:02,080
And the best way I know to
figure out the slope and

121
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,460
y-intercept is to put it into
slope-intercept form.

122
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:09,310
So we want to put these
equations right here into the

123
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:12,820
form, y is equal to mx plus b.

124
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,740
So we're essentially
solving for y.

125
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,510
Let's do that.

126
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:19,420
So the best thing to do here--
so let me rewrite it.

127
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:26,860
5x minus 2y is equal to 15.

128
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,680
Let's subtract 5x
from both sides.

129
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:36,530
So minus 5x plus, you
have a minus 5x.

130
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,690
These cancel out.

131
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:40,310
And so you're left with
negative 2y is

132
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:44,580
equal to 15 minus 5x.

133
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:48,750
And now, let's divide everything
by negative 2.

134
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:54,960
If you divide everything by
negative 2, what do we get?

135
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,620
The left-hand side
just becomes a y.

136
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:04,530
y is equal to-- 15 divided by
negative 2 is negative 7.5.

137
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:07,310
And then negative 5 divided by
negative 2-- you can imagine

138
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:10,540
I'm distributing the negative
1/2 if you will.

139
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,410
I'm dividing both of these
by negative 2.

140
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:16,955
So negative 5 divided by
negative 2 is positive 2.5x.

141
00:07:16,955 --> 00:07:20,210
   

142
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:21,820
And if you really wanted to put
it in the slope-intercept

143
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,760
form, you could say that y is
equal to-- you could just

144
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:29,030
rearrange these--
2.5x minus 7.5.

145
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,430
You want the slope.

146
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,710
It's right here.

147
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:35,490
That is our slope.

148
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:38,070
You want the y-intercept.

149
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,690
Actually, let me be careful.

150
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:42,110
It is right there.

151
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:44,230
It is negative 7.5.

152
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,520
That is the y-intercept.

153
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,090
And now this would be a form
that's actually pretty

154
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:49,650
straightforward to
graph it in.

155
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:52,120
Let's do this one.

156
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,320
So once again, we just
need to solve for y.

157
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,990
So let's subtract 3x
from both sides.

158
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:02,100
So you get 6y is equal
to 25 minus 3x.

159
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,560
And then you can divide
both sides by 6.

160
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:11,870
So you're left with y is equal
to 25 over 6 minus 3 over 6,

161
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:14,060
or minus 1/2x.

162
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,550
If you really want it in this
from, you just rearrange this.

163
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:22,980
y is equal to negative
1/2x plus 25 over 6.

164
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,610
Where is the slope?

165
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:25,890
Here is the slope.

166
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:28,670
Negative 1/2, that
is the slope.

167
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,220
Where is the y-intercept?

168
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,790
That's the y-intercept.

169
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,030
That is our b.

170
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:36,830
The point 0, 25 over
6 is on the line.

171
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,240
Let's do one more of these.

172
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,929
   

173
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:47,080
So we get 9x minus
9y is equal to 4.

174
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,670
Just for fun, let's just start
off by dividing both sides of

175
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,960
the equation by 9.

176
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,080
You don't have to
do it that way.

177
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,100
But this is kind of a fun way
to do it, because the

178
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,460
coefficients here will
immediately become 1.

179
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:03,250
So if you divide both sides of
the equation by 9, if you

180
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:08,970
divide everything by 9, it
becomes-- actually, well,

181
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:09,960
let's divide everything.

182
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:14,530
Let's divide everything by
negative 9, even better.

183
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:16,010
I'm just doing this for fun.

184
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:19,140
So this first term will
become negative x.

185
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,120
The second term, you have a
negative 9 divided by a

186
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,620
negative 9, it will
be a plus y.

187
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,760
And then this last term
will just become a

188
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,800
negative 4 over 9.

189
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,110
Actually, let me write
this out here.

190
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:33,540
Negative 4 over 9.

191
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,380
I'm giving some space there.

192
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:38,270
Now, we want the x on the
right-hand side, so let's add

193
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,836
x to both sides of
this equation.

194
00:09:39,836 --> 00:09:44,150
   

195
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,720
These cancel out.

196
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:51,960
And then the equation becomes
y is equal to x minus 4/9.

197
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,530
Where is the slope?

198
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:55,460
The slope is the coefficient
on the x term.

199
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:58,990
The slope is equal to 1.

200
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,270
Where is the y-intercept?

201
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:02,956
The y-intercept is
right there.

202
00:10:02,956 --> 00:10:06,040
It is negative 4/9.

203
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,000
