1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,580
   

2
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,950
A card game using 36 unique
cards, four suits, diamonds,

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,500
hearts, clubs, and spades, with
cards numbered from 1 to

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,410
9 in each suit.

5
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:10,440
So there's four suits.

6
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,220
Each of them have nine
cards, so that gives

7
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,330
us 36 unique cards.

8
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:17,980
A hand is a collection of nine
cards, which can be sorted

9
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,310
however the player chooses.

10
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,000
So they're essentially telling
us that order does not matter.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,900
What is the probability of
getting all four of the 1's?

12
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:31,900
So they want to know the
probability of getting all

13
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,670
four of the 1's.

14
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:43,340
So all four 1's in
my hand of 9.

15
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,850
Now this is kind of daunting at
first. You're like, gee you

16
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:48,160
know, I've got nine cards and
I'm taking them out of 36 and

17
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,200
I have to figure out how do
I get all of the 1's.

18
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,240
But if we think about it just
very, very, in very simple

19
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:58,400
terms, all a probability is
saying is, the number of

20
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,660
events-- or I guess you could
say-- the number of ways in

21
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:05,030
which this action or
this event happens.

22
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,960
So this is what the definition
of the probability is.

23
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:18,210
It's going to be the number of
ways in which event can happen

24
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,910
and when we talk about the
event, we're talking about

25
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:23,270
having all four 1's
in my hand.

26
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:24,480
That's the event.

27
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,810
And all of these different ways,
that's sometimes called

28
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:28,740
the event space.

29
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,100
But we actually want to count
how many ways that, if I get a

30
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,890
hand of 9 picking from
36, that I can get

31
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,120
the four 1's in it.

32
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,730
So it is the number of ways in
which my event can happen and

33
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:48,480
we want to divide that into all
of the possibilities-- or

34
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,220
maybe I should write it this
way-- the total number of

35
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,470
hands that I can get.

36
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:58,520
   

37
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:03,900
So the numerator in blue is the
number of different hands

38
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:08,639
where I have the four 1's and
we're dividing the total

39
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,449
number of hands.

40
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:11,620
Now let's figure out the total
number of hands first, because

41
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,360
on some level this might be
more intuitive and we've

42
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,290
actually done this before.

43
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:17,040
Now, the total number
of hands, we're

44
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,840
picking nine cards.

45
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,900
And we're picking them from
a set of 36 unique cards.

46
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,510
And we've done this
many, many times.

47
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:29,500
Let me write this, total number
of hands, or total

48
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,420
number of possible hands.

49
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,780
That's equal to-- you can
imagine, you have nine cards

50
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,750
to pick from.

51
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:39,010
The first card you pick, it's
going to be 1 of 36 cards.

52
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:41,220
Then the next one is going
to be 1 of 35.

53
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:46,130
Then the next one is going to
be 1 of 34, 33, 32, 31.

54
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,550
We're going to do this nine
times, one, two, three, four,

55
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:55,160
five, six, seven,
eight, and nine.

56
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,375
So that would be the
total number of

57
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:59,000
hands if order mattered.

58
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,800
But we know-- and we've gone
over this before-- that we

59
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,500
don't care about the order.

60
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,650
All we care about are the actual
cars that are in there.

61
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,310
So we're overcounting here.

62
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,850
We're overcounting for all of
the different rearrangements

63
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:13,550
that these cards could have. It
doesn't matter whether the

64
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,540
Ace of diamonds is the
first card I pick or

65
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,730
the last card I pick.

66
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,980
The way I've counted them right
now, we are counting

67
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,110
those as two separate hands.

68
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,770
But they aren't two
separate hands, so

69
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:23,560
order doesn't matter.

70
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,500
So we have to do is, we have to
divide this by the number

71
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,600
of ways you can arrange
nine things.

72
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,800
So you could put nine of the
things in the first position,

73
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,500
then eight in the second,
seven in the third, so

74
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,950
forth and so on.

75
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:41,450
It essentially becomes 9
factorial times 2 times 1.

76
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:42,920
And we've seen this
multiple times.

77
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,400
This is essentially
36 choose 9.

78
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,700
This expression right here is
the same thing-- just you can

79
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,880
relate it to the combinatorics
formulas that you might be

80
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,470
familiar with-- this is the
same thing as 36 factorial

81
00:03:55,470 --> 00:04:00,480
over 36 minus 9 factorial--
that's what this orange part

82
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,930
is over here-- divided by 9
factorial or over 9 factorial.

83
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:09,410
What's green is what's green and
what is orange is what's

84
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:09,980
orange there.

85
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,990
So that's the total
number of hands.

86
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:14,730
Now a little bit more of a
nuanced thought process is,

87
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,720
how do we figure out the number
of ways in which the

88
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,695
event can happen, in which
we can have all four 1's.

89
00:04:19,695 --> 00:04:21,680
So let's figure that out.

90
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:28,050
So number of ways-- or maybe we
should say this-- number of

91
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:34,355
hands with four 1's.

92
00:04:34,355 --> 00:04:37,420
   

93
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,310
And just as a little bit of a
thought experiment, imagine if

94
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,600
we were only taking four cards,
if a hand only had four

95
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,710
cards in it.

96
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:48,270
Well if a hand only had four
cards in it, then the number

97
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:52,240
of ways to get a hand with four
1's, there'd only be one

98
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,950
way, one combination.

99
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,200
You'd just have four 1's.

100
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,550
That's the only combination with
four 1's, if we were only

101
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,130
picking four cards.

102
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:03,010
But here, we're not only
picking four cards.

103
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:08,210
Four of the cards are
going to be 1's.

104
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:10,480
One, two, three, four.

105
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,660
But the other five cards are
going to be different.

106
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:17,210
So one, two, three,
four, five.

107
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:22,460
So for the other five cards--
if you imagine this slot--

108
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:26,880
considering that of the 36 we
would have to pick four of

109
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,640
them already in order for
us to have four 1's.

110
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,260
Well, we've used up four of
them, so there's 32 possible

111
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:38,500
cards over in that position
of the hand.

112
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,750
And then there'd be 31 in that
position of the hand.

113
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,480
And then there'd be 30 because
every time we're picking a

114
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,400
card, were using it up.

115
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,720
And now we only have
30 to pick from.

116
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,440
Then we only have
29 to pick from.

117
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,820
And then we have 28
to pick from.

118
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:56,020
And just like we did before,
we don't care about order.

119
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,055
We don't care if we pick the 5
of clubs first or whether we

120
00:05:59,055 --> 00:06:01,680
pick the 5 of clubs last. So we
shouldn't double count it.

121
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,380
So we have to divide by the
different number of ways that

122
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,670
five cards can be arranged.

123
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:12,310
So we have to divide this by the
different ways that five

124
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,190
cards can be arranged.

125
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:15,890
The first card or the first
position can be any one of

126
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:19,210
five cards, then four cards,
then three cards, then two

127
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,830
cards, then one cards.

128
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:23,040
So the number of hands
with four 1's is

129
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,060
actually just this number.

130
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,400
You're actually looking at all
of the different ways you can

131
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,840
fill up the remaining cards.

132
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,350
These four 1's are just
going to be four 1's.

133
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:34,060
There's only one way to get that
if the remaining cards

134
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,810
that's going to give all of the
different combinations of

135
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:37,900
having four 1's.

136
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,350
So this will be a count of all
of the different combinations

137
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:42,780
because all of the different
extra stuff that you have will

138
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,520
be all of the different hands.

139
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,930
Now we know the total
number of hands with

140
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,550
four 1's is this number.

141
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,010
And now we can divide
it by the total

142
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,210
number of possible hands.

143
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,280
And I didn't multiply them out
on purpose so that we can

144
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,240
cancel things out.

145
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,530
So let's do that.

146
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,950
Let's take this and
divide by that.

147
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,460
So let me just copy
and paste it.

148
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:06,140
   

149
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:10,870
Let's take that and let's
divide it by that.

150
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:13,780
But dividing by a fraction is
the same thing as multiplying

151
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:14,820
by the reciprocal.

152
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,250
So let's just multiply
by the reciprocal.

153
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,350
So let's multiply-- so this
is the denominator.

154
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:22,300
Let's make this the numerator.

155
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,900
So let me copy it and then
let me paste it.

156
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,440
So that's the numerator
and then that's the

157
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,900
denominator up there.

158
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,720
Because we're dividing
by that expression.

159
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:37,110
So let me-- whoops.

160
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,050
Let me put that there.

161
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:42,590
Let me get the select tool and
then let me make sure I'm

162
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:45,110
selecting all of the numbers.

163
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:47,970
Let me copy it and then
let me paste that.

164
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,880
It's a little messy with those
lines there, but I think

165
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,070
this'll suit our purposes.

166
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:56,260
This'll suit our purposes
just fine.

167
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,890
So when we're multiplying by
this, we're essentially

168
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:00,130
dividing by this expression
up here.

169
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:03,250
Now this we can simplify
pretty easily.

170
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:07,820
We have a-- well actually I
forgot to do-- this should be

171
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,610
9 factorial.

172
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:12,070
This should be 9 times 8 times
7 times 6 times 5 times 4

173
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,570
times 3 times 2 times 1.

174
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:15,260
Let me put that in
both places.

175
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:20,190
Actually let me just-- let me
clear that both places.

176
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:20,620
Clear.

177
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,470
Don't want to confuse people.

178
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,520
Clear.

179
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,280
I'm sorry if that confused you
when I wrote it earlier.

180
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,260
This would be 9 factorial.

181
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:33,190
9 times 8 times 7 times 6
times 5 times 4 times 3

182
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:35,230
times 2 times 1.

183
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:38,760
Let me copy and paste
that now.

184
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,230
Copy and then you paste.

185
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:44,190
It That's that, right there.

186
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,960
And then we have this
in the numerator.

187
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,720
We have 5 times 4 times 3 times
1 in the denominator.

188
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,400
So this will cancel out with
that part right over there.

189
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:58,980
And then we have 32 times 31
times 30 times 29 times 28.

190
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,150
That is going to cancel
with that.

191
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:04,230
That and that cancels out.

192
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,630
So what we're left with is
just this part over here.

193
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,650
Let me rewrite it.

194
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:15,710
So we're left with 9 times 8
times 7 times 6 over-- and

195
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:18,380
this will just be an exercise
in simplifying this

196
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:23,920
expression-- 36 times 35
times 34 times 33.

197
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,360
And let's see, if we divide the
numerator and denominator

198
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,550
by 9, that becomes a 1,
this becomes a 4.

199
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,780
You can divide the numerator
and denominator by 4, this

200
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,710
becomes a 2.

201
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:35,680
This becomes a 1.

202
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,470
You divide numerator and
denominator by 7, this becomes

203
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:42,530
a 1, this becomes a 5.

204
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:46,170
You can divide both by 2 again
and then this becomes a 1.

205
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:48,140
This becomes a 17.

206
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,500
And you could divide
this and this by 3.

207
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:55,260
This becomes a 2 and then
this becomes an 11.

208
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:59,550
So we're left with, the
probability of having all four

209
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:04,100
1's in my hand of 9 that I'm
selecting from 36 unique cards

210
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,970
is equal to-- in the numerator,
I'm just left with

211
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:10,880
this 2 times 1 times 1 times 1--
so it's equal to 2 over 5

212
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,150
times 17 times 11.

213
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:19,980
And that is-- so drum roll, this
was kind of an involved

214
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:28,660
problem-- 5 times 17 times
11 is equal to 935.

215
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:34,150
So it's equal to 2 over 935.

216
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:37,800
So about roughly 2 in a thousand
chance or 1 in a

217
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,040
500-- roughly speaking, this
isn't exact odds-- you have a

218
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,020
roughly 1 in 500 chance of
getting all four of the 1's in

219
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,000
your hand of 9 when
you're selecting

220
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,190
from 36 unique cards.

221
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:50,533
