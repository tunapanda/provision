1
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:11,938
Your personal ancestry story begins

2
00:00:14,707 --> 00:00:18,454
with the shared story of our human ancestry.

3
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:25,152
You and your distant cousin, the chimpanzee,

4
00:00:25,152 --> 00:00:27,492
have a common ancestor.

5
00:00:27,492 --> 00:00:30,880
which lived about 6.5 million years ago.

6
00:00:31,772 --> 00:00:35,264
We can learn about this common ancestor by

7
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:38,396
noting what makes us similar to chimps.

8
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:44,747
But many things also distinguish us from chimpanzees,

9
00:00:44,747 --> 00:00:48,847
like our big brains, which enable abstract reasoning

10
00:00:48,847 --> 00:00:51,600
and the development of complex languages.

11
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,466
And our anatomy, adapted to up-right walking,

12
00:00:57,743 --> 00:01:02,991
these human traits developed gradually over millions of years.

13
00:01:04,068 --> 00:01:08,453
The fossil record reveals a long and eventful

14
00:01:08,453 --> 00:01:10,750
parade of human ancestors.

15
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:15,899
During some periods, several of our ancestors co-existed.

16
00:01:16,561 --> 00:01:21,115
Gradually, they became more efficient up-right walkers.

17
00:01:21,115 --> 00:01:25,501
And later, developed skulls with larger brain cases

18
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:29,590
devoted more to thinking and less to chewing.

19
00:01:31,513 --> 00:01:35,043
Our knowledge of the exact relationships between

20
00:01:35,043 --> 00:01:37,634
these ancestors is incomplete.

21
00:01:37,634 --> 00:01:41,205
And often, is revised, because of new fossil finds.

22
00:01:43,543 --> 00:01:46,475
Some of them were our direct ancestors,

23
00:01:46,475 --> 00:01:49,575
some of them were distant cousins,

24
00:01:49,575 --> 00:01:52,973
who became evolutionary dead ends.

25
00:01:54,096 --> 00:01:56,995
But by 200,000 years ago,

26
00:01:56,995 --> 00:01:59,863
we're on firmer ground.

27
00:01:59,863 --> 00:02:02,096
We find the bones of people in Africa,

28
00:02:02,096 --> 00:02:05,178
who looked something like us,

29
00:02:06,563 --> 00:02:10,537
not exactly like us, but close.

30
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:18,143
They built fires and flaked stone into spear heads, knifes, and scrapers.

31
00:02:18,143 --> 00:02:20,727
They were physically strong,

32
00:02:20,727 --> 00:02:24,444
and still depended on their muscles, not their technology

33
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:26,370
for much of their survival.

34
00:02:27,262 --> 00:02:30,158
Here, in addition to fossils,

35
00:02:30,158 --> 00:02:33,862
we have genetics to help us find our prehistoric kin.

36
00:02:35,462 --> 00:02:38,925
All of this, living today, inherited our DNA

37
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:43,332
from this small group of ancient people in Africa.

38
00:02:44,686 --> 00:02:49,064
Over time, they began to look more and more like us.

39
00:02:49,064 --> 00:02:55,415
And by 100,000 years ago, their skeletons weren't so different

40
00:02:55,415 --> 00:03:01,078
from ours, but these early Homo sapiens shared the planet

41
00:03:01,078 --> 00:03:04,043
with two of their distant cousins.

42
00:03:04,043 --> 00:03:08,045
By this time, as a result of previous migrations,

43
00:03:08,045 --> 00:03:14,496
Homo erectus was living across Asia, and had been for 2 million years.

44
00:03:15,634 --> 00:03:19,595
Homo erectus had a big brain, some made hand axes,

45
00:03:19,595 --> 00:03:24,546
some do fires, and some may even have worn clothing.

46
00:03:24,546 --> 00:03:31,587
At the same time, Neanderthals lived across Europe, and western and

47
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:35,756
central Asia. They had even bigger brains.

48
00:03:36,894 --> 00:03:40,676
They made spears and stone tools, similar to those

49
00:03:40,676 --> 00:03:46,675
found in Africa, and we suspect they had strong social relationships.

50
00:03:47,237 --> 00:03:52,160
They cared for the sick, and infirm, and buried their dead.

51
00:03:53,622 --> 00:03:59,466
Not so very different, culturally, from early Homo sapiens, it seems

52
00:03:59,466 --> 00:04:05,192
that our human anatomy developed before our complex human culture.

53
00:04:06,684 --> 00:04:09,280
But things were about to change.

54
00:04:10,311 --> 00:04:14,992
Today, we live in all climates, all over the world;

55
00:04:14,992 --> 00:04:19,712
and are unique, in our dependence on our cultures for survival.

56
00:04:19,712 --> 00:04:25,128
How we got from there, to here,

57
00:04:25,128 --> 00:04:29,302
forms the next chapters in our human story.
