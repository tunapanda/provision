1
00:00:01,062 --> 00:00:03,636
This right here is a picture of René Descartes

2
00:00:03,636 --> 00:00:05,698
Once again one of the great minds,

3
00:00:05,698 --> 00:00:07,554
in both math and philosophy.

4
00:00:07,554 --> 00:00:09,923
And i think you'll be seeing bit of a little trend here

5
00:00:09,923 --> 00:00:13,190
that the great philosphers were also great mathematicians

6
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:15,200
and vice versa

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,021
and he was somewhat of a contemporary of Galileo

8
00:00:17,021 --> 00:00:18,733
he was 32 years younger.

9
00:00:18,733 --> 00:00:21,706
although he died shortly after Galileo died.

10
00:00:21,706 --> 00:00:23,467
This guy died at a much younger age,

11
00:00:23,467 --> 00:00:25,400
Galileo was well into his 70's

12
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,067
Descartes died at what, this is only at 54 years old.

13
00:00:28,067 --> 00:00:30,867
And he is probably most known in popular culture,

14
00:00:30,867 --> 00:00:32,733
for this quote right over here.

15
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:33,800
a very philosophical quote.

16
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,867
"I think therefore I am"

17
00:00:35,867 --> 00:00:37,467
but i also wanted to throw in,

18
00:00:37,467 --> 00:00:38,867
and this isn't that related to algebra,

19
00:00:38,867 --> 00:00:40,733
but i just thought it was a really neat quote.

20
00:00:40,733 --> 00:00:42,800
Probably his least famous quote.

21
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,467
This one right over here.

22
00:00:44,467 --> 00:00:46,800
And i like it just because it's very practical

23
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,852
and it makes you realize that these great minds

24
00:00:48,852 --> 00:00:51,113
these pillars of philosophy and mathematics

25
00:00:51,113 --> 00:00:52,282
that at the end of the day,

26
00:00:52,282 --> 00:00:54,467
they were just human beings.

27
00:00:54,467 --> 00:00:56,498
and he said, "You just keep pushing.

28
00:00:56,498 --> 00:00:58,133
You just keep pushing.

29
00:00:58,133 --> 00:01:00,015
I made every mistake that could be made.

30
00:01:00,015 --> 00:01:02,031
But I just kept pushing."

31
00:01:02,031 --> 00:01:05,267
Which i think is very very good life advice.

32
00:01:05,267 --> 00:01:07,733
Now he did many things

33
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:09,077
in philosophy and mathematics

34
00:01:09,077 --> 00:01:11,062
but the reason why I'm including here

35
00:01:11,062 --> 00:01:12,933
as we build foundations of algebra

36
00:01:12,933 --> 00:01:15,600
is that he is the individual

37
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,800
most responsible for a very strong connection

38
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,425
between algebra and geometry.

39
00:01:21,425 --> 00:01:22,898
so on the left over here

40
00:01:22,898 --> 00:01:24,752
you have the world of algebra.

41
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:26,415
We've discussed it a little bit.

42
00:01:26,415 --> 00:01:28,477
You have equations that deal with symbols

43
00:01:28,477 --> 00:01:30,236
and these symbols are essentially

44
00:01:30,236 --> 00:01:31,933
they can take on values

45
00:01:31,933 --> 00:01:32,800
so you can have something like

46
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:37,677
y = 2x - 1

47
00:01:37,677 --> 00:01:39,267
this gives us a relationship

48
00:01:39,267 --> 00:01:40,733
between whatever x is

49
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:42,133
and whatever y is.

50
00:01:42,133 --> 00:01:44,333
and we can even set up a table here.

51
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:46,733
and pick values for x

52
00:01:46,733 --> 00:01:48,292
and see what the values of y would be.

53
00:01:48,292 --> 00:01:51,652
I can just pick random values for x

54
00:01:51,652 --> 00:01:53,133
and then figure out what y is.

55
00:01:53,133 --> 00:01:55,000
but i'll pick relatively straightforward values

56
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,662
and so that the maths doesn't get too complicated.

57
00:01:57,662 --> 00:01:59,252
so for example,

58
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:00,533
if x is -2

59
00:02:00,533 --> 00:02:03,600
then y is going to be 2 x -2 - 1

60
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,513
2 x -2 - 1

61
00:02:06,513 --> 00:02:10,113
which is -4 - 1

62
00:02:10,113 --> 00:02:12,267
which is -5

63
00:02:12,267 --> 00:02:14,785
if x is -1

64
00:02:14,785 --> 00:02:20,452
then y is going to be 2 x -1 - 1

65
00:02:20,452 --> 00:02:21,733
which is equal to

66
00:02:21,733 --> 00:02:24,554
this is -2 - 1 which is -3

67
00:02:24,554 --> 00:02:28,725
if x = 0

68
00:02:28,725 --> 00:02:32,590
then y is going to be 2 x 0 - 1

69
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,667
2 x 0 is 0 - 1 is just -1

70
00:02:35,667 --> 00:02:37,333
i'll do a couple more.

71
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:38,282
if x is 1

72
00:02:38,282 --> 00:02:39,421
and i could've picked any values here

73
00:02:39,421 --> 00:02:40,352
I could've said what happens

74
00:02:40,352 --> 00:02:42,005
if x is the negative square root of 2

75
00:02:42,005 --> 00:02:45,067
or what happens if x is -5 halves

76
00:02:45,067 --> 00:02:47,867
or positive six seventh.

77
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:49,000
but i'm just picking these numbers

78
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,600
because it makes the maths a lot easier

79
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,600
when i try to figure out what y is going to be.

80
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,133
but when x is 1

81
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:57,338
y is going to be 2(1) - 1

82
00:02:57,338 --> 00:02:59,733
2 x 1 is 2 - 1 is 1

83
00:02:59,733 --> 00:03:03,052
and i'll do one more.

84
00:03:03,052 --> 00:03:05,133
in the colour I have not used yet.

85
00:03:05,133 --> 00:03:06,667
let's see this purple.

86
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:08,041
if x is 2

87
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:09,333
then y is going to be

88
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:14,005
2(2) - 1 (now that x is 2)

89
00:03:14,005 --> 00:03:16,615
so that is 4 - 1, is equal to 3

90
00:03:16,615 --> 00:03:17,800
so fair enough,

91
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,548
I just kind of sampled this relationship.

92
00:03:19,548 --> 00:03:22,533
But I said okay this describes a general relationship

93
00:03:22,533 --> 00:03:25,200
between a variable y and a variable x

94
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,908
and then I just made a little more concrete.

95
00:03:26,908 --> 00:03:28,000
I said ok well then

96
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,882
if x is one of these variables.

97
00:03:29,882 --> 00:03:31,200
for each of these values of x,

98
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,800
what would be the corresponding value of y?

99
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,698
and what Descartes realized is

100
00:03:35,717 --> 00:03:37,467
that you could visualize this.

101
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:40,405
what you could visualize is individual points.

102
00:03:40,405 --> 00:03:42,667
But that could also help you in general

103
00:03:42,667 --> 00:03:45,800
to visualize this relationship.

104
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,333
so what he essentially did is

105
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:52,329
he bridged the worlds of this kind of very abstract symbolic algebra.

106
00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:55,200
and that and geometry which was concerned

107
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,600
with shapes and sizes and angles.

108
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:02,933
so over here you have the world of geometry.

109
00:04:02,933 --> 00:04:04,887
and obviously there are people in history

110
00:04:04,887 --> 00:04:07,067
maybe many people who history may have forgotten

111
00:04:07,067 --> 00:04:09,067
who might have dabbled in this.

112
00:04:09,067 --> 00:04:12,467
But before Descartes is generally viewed.

113
00:04:12,467 --> 00:04:14,800
that geometry was euclidean geometry.

114
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,133
and that's essentially the geometry

115
00:04:16,133 --> 00:04:17,533
that you studied in geometry class

116
00:04:17,533 --> 00:04:20,333
in 8th or 9th or 10th grade.

117
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,533
in a traditional high school curriculum.

118
00:04:22,533 --> 00:04:24,200
and that's the geometry of studying

119
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,554
the relationships between triangles, and their angles.

120
00:04:28,554 --> 00:04:30,667
and the relationships between circles.

121
00:04:30,667 --> 00:04:33,887
and you have radii and then you have triangles

122
00:04:33,887 --> 00:04:36,200
inscribed in circles and all the rest

123
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,190
and we'll go into some depth

124
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,667
in that in the geometry playlist.

125
00:04:39,667 --> 00:04:42,938
But Descarte says, 'well i think i can represent this visually

126
00:04:42,938 --> 00:04:46,581
the same way Euclid was studying these triangles and these circles'

127
00:04:46,581 --> 00:04:48,299
he said 'why don't I ?'

128
00:04:48,299 --> 00:04:50,575
if we view a piece of paper.

129
00:04:50,575 --> 00:04:52,339
if we think about a two-dimensional plane.

130
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:53,825
you could view a piece of paper

131
00:04:53,825 --> 00:04:55,915
as kind of a section of a two-dimensional plane.

132
00:04:55,915 --> 00:04:57,819
we call it two-dimensions

133
00:04:57,819 --> 00:04:59,584
because there's two directions that you can go in.

134
00:04:59,584 --> 00:05:01,256
there's the up down direction,

135
00:05:01,256 --> 00:05:02,510
that's one direction.

136
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,825
so let me draw that, i'll do it in blue.

137
00:05:04,841 --> 00:05:06,666
because we're trying to visualize things

138
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:08,384
so i'll do it the geometry colour.

139
00:05:08,384 --> 00:05:11,827
so you have the up down direction

140
00:05:11,827 --> 00:05:14,139
and you have the left right direction.

141
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:16,720
that's why it's called a two-dimensional plane.

142
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,160
if we're dealing with three-dimensions.

143
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,339
you have an in out dimension.

144
00:05:21,339 --> 00:05:23,200
and it's very easy to do two-dimensions on the screen

145
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,425
because the screen is two-dimensional.

146
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,071
and he says 'Well, you know

147
00:05:27,071 --> 00:05:29,744
there are two variables here and they have this relationship.

148
00:05:29,744 --> 00:05:32,548
But why don't I associate each of these variables

149
00:05:32,548 --> 00:05:34,600
with one of these dimensions over here?'

150
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,010
and by convention let's make the y variable

151
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,421
which is really the dependant variable,

152
00:05:39,421 --> 00:05:40,456
The way we did it,

153
00:05:40,456 --> 00:05:41,815
it depends on what x is.

154
00:05:41,815 --> 00:05:43,605
So let's put that on the vertical axis.

155
00:05:43,605 --> 00:05:45,333
and let's put our independent variable,

156
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:46,800
the one where I just randomly picked values for it

157
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,348
to see what y would become,

158
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,867
let's put that on the horizontal axis.

159
00:05:50,867 --> 00:05:52,533
and it actually was Descartes

160
00:05:52,533 --> 00:05:55,600
who came up with a convention of using x's and y's

161
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,600
and we'll see later z's in algebra, so extensively

162
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,098
as unknown variables with the variables that you're manipulating.

163
00:06:02,098 --> 00:06:03,867
But he says 'Well if we think about it this way

164
00:06:03,867 --> 00:06:07,452
if we number these dimensions'

165
00:06:07,452 --> 00:06:09,723
so let's say that in the x direction

166
00:06:09,723 --> 00:06:15,702
let's make this right over here -3

167
00:06:15,702 --> 00:06:17,805
let's make this -2

168
00:06:17,805 --> 00:06:19,498
this is -1

169
00:06:19,498 --> 00:06:21,067
this is 0

170
00:06:21,067 --> 00:06:23,800
i'm just numbering the x direction

171
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,333
the left right direction.

172
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:26,837
now this is positive 1

173
00:06:26,837 --> 00:06:28,338
this is positive 2

174
00:06:28,338 --> 00:06:30,169
and this is positive 3.

175
00:06:30,169 --> 00:06:32,333
and we could do the same in the y direction

176
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,400
so let's see we go, so this could be

177
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:40,400
say this is -5, -4 , -3

178
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,333
actually let me do it a bit neater than that

179
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:45,067
let me clean this up a little bit.

180
00:06:45,067 --> 00:06:47,800
let me erase this and extend this down a little bit

181
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,533
so I can go all the way down to -5

182
00:06:49,533 --> 00:06:51,867
without making it look too messy.

183
00:06:51,867 --> 00:06:53,410
so let's go all the way down here.

184
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:54,867
and so we can number it

185
00:06:54,867 --> 00:06:58,144
this is 1, this is 2, this is 3,

186
00:06:58,144 --> 00:07:00,867
and then this could be -1

187
00:07:00,867 --> 00:07:02,733
-2 and these are all just conventions

188
00:07:02,733 --> 00:07:04,067
it could've been labelled the other way.

189
00:07:04,067 --> 00:07:05,692
we could've decided to put the x there

190
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:06,733
and the y there

191
00:07:06,733 --> 00:07:07,969
and make this the positive direction,

192
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,277
make this the negative direction.

193
00:07:09,277 --> 00:07:11,333
but this is just a convention that people adopted

194
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:12,733
starting with Descartes.

195
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:18,062
-2, -3, -4 and -5

196
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:20,200
and he says 'Well anything i can associate

197
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,667
I can associate each of these pairs of values with

198
00:07:22,667 --> 00:07:25,333
a point in two-dimensions.

199
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:28,467
I can take the x co-ordinate, I can take the x value

200
00:07:28,467 --> 00:07:30,333
right over here and I say 'Ok that's -2

201
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:34,195
that would be right over there along the left right direction,

202
00:07:34,195 --> 00:07:35,831
i'm going to the left because it's negative.'

203
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:39,395
and that's associated with -5 in the vertical direction.

204
00:07:39,395 --> 00:07:41,667
so I say the y value's -5

205
00:07:41,667 --> 00:07:46,400
and so if I go 2 to the left and 5 down.

206
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,267
I get to this point right over there.

207
00:07:49,267 --> 00:07:53,518
so he says 'These two values -2 and -5

208
00:07:53,518 --> 00:07:55,733
I can associate it with this point

209
00:07:55,733 --> 00:07:59,133
in this plane right over here, in this two-dimensional plane.

210
00:07:59,133 --> 00:08:02,933
so I'll say: That point has the co-ordinates,

211
00:08:02,933 --> 00:08:06,400
tells me where do I find that point (-2,-5).

212
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,959
and these coordinates are called 'cartesian coordinates'

213
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,077
named for René Descartes

214
00:08:12,077 --> 00:08:13,800
because he is the guy who came up with these.

215
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,067
He's associating all of a sudden these relationships

216
00:08:15,067 --> 00:08:17,667
with points on a co-ordinate plane.

217
00:08:17,667 --> 00:08:19,800
and then he says 'well ok, lets do another one'

218
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,600
there's this other relationship,

219
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:27,452
when x is equal to -1, y = -3

220
00:08:27,452 --> 00:08:30,031
so x is -1, y is -3.

221
00:08:30,031 --> 00:08:31,544
that's that point right over there.

222
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:33,333
and the convention is once again.

223
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:34,375
'When you list the co-ordinates,

224
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:36,600
you list the x co-ordinate, then the y co-ordinate

225
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,400
and that's just what people decided to do.

226
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:42,067
-1, -3 that would be that point right over there

227
00:08:42,067 --> 00:08:45,933
and then you have the point when x is 0, y is -1

228
00:08:45,933 --> 00:08:48,067
when x is 0 right over here,

229
00:08:48,067 --> 00:08:50,267
which means I don't go the left or the right.

230
00:08:50,267 --> 00:08:52,667
y is -1, which means I go 1 down.

231
00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:56,390
so that's that point right over there. (0,-1)

232
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:57,359
right over there

233
00:08:57,359 --> 00:08:58,852
and I could keep doing this.

234
00:08:58,852 --> 00:09:03,810
when x is 1, y is 1

235
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:09,575
when x is 2, y is 3

236
00:09:09,575 --> 00:09:11,733
actually let me do that in the same purple colour

237
00:09:11,733 --> 00:09:15,400
when x is 2, y is 3

238
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:20,652
2,3 and then this one right over here in orange was 1,1

239
00:09:20,652 --> 00:09:22,195
and this is neat by itself,

240
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:24,615
I essentially just sampled possible x's.

241
00:09:24,615 --> 00:09:25,867
but what he realized is

242
00:09:25,867 --> 00:09:27,775
not only do you sample these possible x's,

243
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:29,677
but it you kept sampling x's,

244
00:09:29,677 --> 00:09:31,318
if you tried sampling all of the x's in between,

245
00:09:31,318 --> 00:09:34,000
you'd actually end up plotting out a line.

246
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,067
So if you were to do every possible x

247
00:09:36,067 --> 00:09:38,067
you would end up getting a line

248
00:09:38,067 --> 00:09:44,492
that looks something like that... right over there.

249
00:09:44,492 --> 00:09:47,533
and any... any relation, if you pick any x

250
00:09:47,533 --> 00:09:50,867
and find any y it really represents a point on this line,

251
00:09:50,867 --> 00:09:52,400
or another way to think about it

252
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,171
any point on this line represents

253
00:09:54,171 --> 00:09:57,051
a solution to this equation right over here.

254
00:09:57,051 --> 00:09:58,902
so if you have this point right over here.

255
00:09:58,902 --> 00:10:01,600
which looks like about x is 1 and a half.

256
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,467
y is 2. So let me write that

257
00:10:03,467 --> 00:10:07,133
1.5,2

258
00:10:07,133 --> 00:10:09,133
that is a solution to this equation.

259
00:10:09,133 --> 00:10:13,652
when x is 1.5. 2 x 1.5 is 3 - 1 is 2

260
00:10:13,652 --> 00:10:15,600
that is right over there.

261
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,400
so all of a sudden he was able to bridge

262
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:22,400
this gap or this relationship between algebra and geometry.

263
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:27,133
we can now visualize all of the x and y pairs

264
00:10:27,133 --> 00:10:31,498
that satisfy this equation right over here.

265
00:10:31,498 --> 00:10:36,092
and so he is responsible for making this bridge

266
00:10:36,092 --> 00:10:38,067
and that's why that co-ordinates

267
00:10:38,067 --> 00:10:42,677
that we use to specify these points are called 'cartesian coordinates'

268
00:10:42,677 --> 00:10:45,467
and as we'll see and first type of equations

269
00:10:45,467 --> 00:10:48,600
we will study our equations of this form over here

270
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,446
and in a traditional algebra curriculum.

271
00:10:50,446 --> 00:10:52,733
they're called linear equations...

272
00:10:52,733 --> 00:10:55,733
linear equations.

273
00:10:55,733 --> 00:10:57,738
and you might be saying: well you know, this is an equation,

274
00:10:57,738 --> 00:10:59,533
I'll see that this is equal to that on its own.

275
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:00,744
but what's so linear about them?

276
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:02,333
what makes them look like a line?

277
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,379
to realize why they're linear,

278
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:07,467
you have to make this jump René Descartes made.

279
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:09,133
because if you were to plot this,

280
00:11:09,133 --> 00:11:10,759
using cartesian coordinates.

281
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:14,492
on a Euclidean plane. You will get a line.

282
00:11:14,492 --> 00:11:15,846
and in the future you'll see that

283
00:11:15,846 --> 00:11:17,723
there's other types of equations where you won't get a line.

284
00:11:17,723 --> 00:11:21,656
you get a curve, or something kind of crazy or funky.
