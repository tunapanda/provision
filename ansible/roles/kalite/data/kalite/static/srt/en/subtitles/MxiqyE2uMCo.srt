99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
A line has a slope of 7 and goes through the point (-4,-11)

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
What is the equation of this line, in slope-intercept form?

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So the equation of any line slope-intercept form is "y=mx+b"

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Where "m" is the slope, and "b" is the "y-intercept".

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now, in this problem right here. They tell us the slope.

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They tell us that the line has a slope of 7.

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we know right from the get go that "m" is equal to 7.

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we know the equation of this line in slope-intercept form is

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
going to look like "y" is equal to..

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we know "m" is 7
