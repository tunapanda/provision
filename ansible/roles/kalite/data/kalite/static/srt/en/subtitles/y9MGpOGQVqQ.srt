1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,860
   

2
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:03,790
We're told to solve for y, and
we have this inequality that

3
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:07,480
says that the absolute value of
y plus 22 is less than or

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,210
equal to 13 and 1/2 or 13.5.

5
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:14,260
So a good place to start is
maybe to just isolate the

6
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,750
absolute value of y on the
left-hand side of this

7
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:17,500
inequality.

8
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,590
And the best way to do
that, we can subtract

9
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,650
22 from both sides.

10
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:25,050
So let's subtract 22
from both sides.

11
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,580
The left-hand side, these guys
cancel out, that was the whole

12
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,930
point, so you're just left with
the absolute value of y

13
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,150
as being less than
or equal to.

14
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,970
And then 13.5 minus 22,
let me do it over

15
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:39,590
here, 13.5 minus 22.

16
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:42,840
My brain imagines, or the way I
process it is, I say, well--

17
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,760
I always like to put the larger
number first-- I say

18
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,540
that's the negative
of 22 minus 13.5.

19
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:56,140
And 22 minus 14 is 8, or the
difference between 22 and 14

20
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,840
is 8, so the difference between
22 and 13 and 1/2 is

21
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,430
going to be 1/2 more
than that.

22
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:03,589
So this is going to be 8.5.

23
00:01:03,589 --> 00:01:05,260
So it's going to be
negative 8.5.

24
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:08,700
   

25
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,780
So we get the absolute value of
y is less than or equal to

26
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,220
negative 8.5.

27
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,990
Now, this should cause you some
pause, because when you

28
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,010
take the absolute value of
anything, what do you know

29
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:22,860
you're going to get?

30
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:28,930
If I tell you that the absolute
value of any number,

31
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,410
oh, we'll just say the
absolute value of

32
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:32,470
a is equal to x.

33
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,330
What do you know about x?

34
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:35,950
You know that x is
non-negative.

35
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:41,270
   

36
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:44,010
It's either a positive
number or 0.

37
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:47,950
Here we're saying that y is,
when we take the absolute

38
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,460
value, has to be less than or
equal to a negative number.

39
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,650
It's saying that it has to
be a negative number.

40
00:01:54,650 --> 00:02:02,070
This is implicitly saying that
the absolute value of y has to

41
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,370
be negative.

42
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:06,220
It not only has to be negative,
it has to be less

43
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,530
than or equal to negative 8.5.

44
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,630
We know that if you take the
absolute value of anything,

45
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,690
you're going to get 0 or
a positive number.

46
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,470
You're going to get a
non-negative number.

47
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,840
There's no number you can put
here whose absolute value's

48
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,240
going to give you a negative
number, especially one less

49
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,530
than negative 8.5.

50
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:24,460
So there is no solution
to this problem.

51
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:27,770
You cannot find a y that
will satisfy this.

52
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:30,940
So there is no solution.

53
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:34,333
