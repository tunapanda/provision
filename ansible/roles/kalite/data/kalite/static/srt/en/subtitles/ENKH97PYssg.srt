1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,460
   

2
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:08,119
Use the commutative law of
multiplication to write 2

3
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:11,130
times 34 in a different way.

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,550
Simplify both expressions
to show that they

5
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:16,420
have identical results.

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:19,250
So once again, this commutative
law just means

7
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,540
that order doesn't matter.

8
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:21,760
It sounds very fancy.

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,910
Commutative law of
multiplication.

10
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,000
But all that says is that it
doesn't matter whether we do 2

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,439
times 34 or whether
we do 34 times 2.

12
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:33,990
The order does not matter.

13
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:38,590
We can commute the two terms.
Both of these are going to get

14
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,510
you the same exact answer.

15
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:41,340
So let's try it out.

16
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,060
What is 2 times 34?

17
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,540
And we could write it like
this, literally.

18
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,230
You'll almost never see it
written like this, but it is

19
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:51,020
literally 2 times 34.

20
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,340
Almost always people write the
larger digit on top, or the

21
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,690
digit with more digits,
or the number with

22
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,415
more digits on top.

23
00:00:58,415 --> 00:00:59,970
But let's do it this way.

24
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:04,300
4 times 2 is 8, and then
we'll put a 0.

25
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:10,510
3 times 2 is 6, or you can view
it as 30 times 2 is 60.

26
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:11,640
Add them together.

27
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,710
8 plus 0 is 8.

28
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,450
6, bring it down.

29
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,560
It's not being added
to anything.

30
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,810
You get 68.

31
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:20,930
So 2 times 34 is 68.

32
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:31,080
Now, if you do 34 times 2, 2
times 4 is 8, 2 times 3 is 6.

33
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,100
That's why it's always nicer to
write the number with more

34
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,280
digits on top.

35
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,150
It also is equal to 68.

36
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:42,150
So it doesn't matter whether you
have two groups of 34 or

37
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,870
thirty-four groups of 2,
in either case, you're

38
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:47,000
going to have 68.

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,667
