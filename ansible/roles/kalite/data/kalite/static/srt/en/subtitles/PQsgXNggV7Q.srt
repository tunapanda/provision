1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,610
   

2
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:06,150
A baby's T-shirt requires 4/5
yards of fabric, or 4/5 of a

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:07,470
yard of fabric.

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,190
How many T-shirts can be
made from 48 yards?

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,250
So what we want to do is we
essentially want to say how

6
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:18,430
many groups of 4/5 of a yard
can we make with 48 yards?

7
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:24,680
So you literally view this as
we want to take 48 yards and

8
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:29,810
divide it into groups of 4/5
of a yard, and say how many

9
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:30,610
groups are there?

10
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:32,430
Because each of those
groups can make

11
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:33,740
one to baby's T-shirt.

12
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:37,110
If you give me 4/5 of a yard,
one baby's T-shirt, so the

13
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,720
number of groups of 4/5 is the
number of babies' T-shirts.

14
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,340
Now, when we divide by a
fraction, we just have to

15
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,970
remember that that is the same
thing, that is completely

16
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:51,030
equivalent to multiplying
times the

17
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,365
reciprocal of the fraction.

18
00:00:52,365 --> 00:00:56,700
So if we have 4/5 here,
that'll be 5/4, the

19
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,660
reciprocal.

20
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,960
Now, you still might say, hey, I
have a whole number here and

21
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,470
a fraction, and you just have
to remember any whole number

22
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:04,099
can be written as a fraction.

23
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:11,340
This is the same thing
as 48/1 times 5/4.

24
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,040
Now, we could just multiply it
out at this point and figure

25
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,380
out what 48 times 5 is and
that'll be over 4, but that'll

26
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,650
get big numbers and it'll be
hard to kind of divide and all

27
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:23,700
that, but we could divide at
this stage right here.

28
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,230
We could divide the numerator
and the denominator by 4.

29
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:30,240
Or we could say, look, this is
going to be equal to 48 times

30
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,070
5, whatever that is, over 4.

31
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:36,370
Now, let's divide the
numerator by 4.

32
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:40,500
Well, we could divide 48 by 4,
and we will get to 12, and

33
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,090
whatever we did to the
numerator, we have to do to

34
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,750
the denominator, so if we
divide 4 by 4, we get 1.

35
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:51,090
So then we're left with 12 times
5, which is equal to 60.

36
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:56,820
12 times 5, which is equal to
60/1, which is the exact same

37
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,540
thing as 60.

38
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:02,960
So you can actually make 60
children's or babies' T-shirts

39
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,300
from 48 yards if each of
them use 4/5 of a yard.

40
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:07,734
