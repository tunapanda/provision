1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,590
   

2
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:05,630
Let's say I have the point
3 comma negative 4.

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:08,740
So that would be 1, 2,
3, and then down 4.

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,530
1, 2, 3, 4.

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,910
So that's 3 comma negative 4.

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,310
And I also had the
point 6 comma 1.

7
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:22,050
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 comma 1.

8
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,510
So just like that.

9
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:25,560
6 comma 1.

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,750
In the last video, we figured
out that we could just use the

11
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,530
Pythagorean theorem if we
wanted to figure out the

12
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,270
distance between these
two points.

13
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:35,000
We just drew a triangle there
and realized that this was the

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,870
hypotenuse.

15
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,570
In this video, we're going to
try to figure out what is the

16
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:42,980
coordinate of the point that
is exactly halfway between

17
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,170
this point and that point?

18
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,510
So this right here is kind of
the distance, the line that

19
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:48,000
connects them.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,500
Now what is the coordinate of
the point that is exactly

21
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,520
halfway in between the two?

22
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,910
What is this coordinate
right here?

23
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,830
It's something comma
something.

24
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,280
And to do that-- let me draw
it really big here.

25
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,590
Because I think you're going to
find out that it's actually

26
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:06,255
pretty straightforward.

27
00:01:06,255 --> 00:01:08,050
At first it seems like a
really tough problem.

28
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:10,620
Gee, let me use the distance
formula with some variables.

29
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,490
But you're going to see, it's
actually one of the simplest

30
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:15,210
things you'll learn in
algebra and geometry.

31
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,430
So let's say that this is
my triangle right there.

32
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:22,020
   

33
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,830
This right here is the
point 6 comma 1.

34
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:28,240
This down here is the point
3 comma negative 4.

35
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,310
And we're looking for the point
that is smack dab in

36
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,840
between those two points.

37
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,090
What are its coordinates?

38
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:38,110
It seems very hard at first. But
it's easy when you think

39
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:41,360
about it in terms of just the
x and the y coordinates.

40
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,700
What's this guy's x-coordinate
going to be?

41
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:48,000
This line out here represents
x is equal to 6.

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,530
This over here-- let me do it
in a little darker color--

43
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:52,460
this over here represents
x is equal to 6.

44
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:55,120
This over here represents
x is equal to 3.

45
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,690
What will this guy's
x-coordinate be?

46
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:01,530
Well, his x-coordinate is
going to be smack dab in

47
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,660
between the two x-coordinates.

48
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,980
This is x is equal to 3, this
is x is equal to 6.

49
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,760
He's going to be right
in between.

50
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,830
This distance is going to be
equal to that distance.

51
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,020
His x-coordinate is going
to be right in between

52
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,770
the 3 and the 6.

53
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,800
So what do we call the number
that's right in between

54
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,710
the 3 and the 6?

55
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:22,650
Well we could call that the
midpoint, or we could call it

56
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,540
the mean, or the average,
or however you want

57
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,180
to talk about it.

58
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,980
We just want to know, what's
the average of 3 and 6?

59
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,730
So to figure out this point,
the point halfway between 3

60
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:35,700
and 6, you literally just figure
out, 3 plus 6 over 2.

61
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,280
Which is equal to 4.5.

62
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,000
So this x-coordinate
is going to be 4.5.

63
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,050
Let me draw that
on this graph.

64
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:48,330
1, 2, 3, 4.5.

65
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,050
And you see, it's smack
dab in between.

66
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,610
That's its x-coordinate.

67
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:57,440
Now, by the exact same logic,
this guy's y-coordinate is

68
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,740
going to be smack dab between y
is equal to negative 4 and y

69
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,650
is equal to 1.

70
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,520
So it's going to be right
in between those.

71
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,450
So this is the x right there.

72
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:12,810
The y-coordinate is going to be
right in between y is equal

73
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,470
to negative 4 and
y is equal to 1.

74
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,040
So you just take the average.

75
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,390
1 plus negative 4 over 2.

76
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:23,040
That's equal to negative 3
over 2 or you could say

77
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,940
negative 1.5.

78
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,630
So you go down 1.5.

79
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:30,450
It is literally right there.

80
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,200
So just like that.

81
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,260
You literally take the average
of the x's, take the average

82
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,370
of the y's, or maybe I should
say the mean to be a little

83
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,150
bit more specific.

84
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,840
A mean of only two points.

85
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,320
And you will get the midpoint
of those two points.

86
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,840
The point that's equidistant
from both of them.

87
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,380
It's the midpoint of the line
that connects them.

88
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:53,150
So the coordinates are 4.5
comma negative 1.5.

89
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,200
Let's do a couple
more of these.

90
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,560
These, actually, you're going
to find are very, very

91
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,970
straightforward.

92
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:00,690
But just to visualize
it, let me graph it.

93
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,660
Let's say I have the point
4, negative 5.

94
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,270
So 1, 2, 3, 4.

95
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,100
And then go down 5.

96
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,160
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

97
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,420
So that's 4, negative 5.

98
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,960
And I have the point
8 comma 2.

99
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:17,100
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8 comma 2.

100
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,410
8 comma 2.

101
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:20,149
So what is the coordinate
of the midpoint

102
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:20,899
of these two points?

103
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:23,600
The point that is smack
dab in between them?

104
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,970
Well, we just average the
x's, average the y's.

105
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,020
So the midpoint is going to be--
the x values are 8 and 4.

106
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,260
It's going to be 8
plus 4 over 2.

107
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,660
And the y value is going to be--
well, we have a 2 and a

108
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,510
negative 5.

109
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:40,220
So you get 2 plus negative
5 over 2.

110
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,460
And what is this equal to?

111
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:48,750
This is 12 over 2, which is 6
comma 2 minus 5 is negative 3.

112
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:53,280
Negative 3 over 2
is negative 1.5.

113
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,610
So that right there
is the midpoint.

114
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:01,040
You literally just average the
x's and average the y's, or

115
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,660
find their means.

116
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,820
So let's graph it,
just to make sure

117
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,220
it looks like midpoint.

118
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,170
6, negative 5.

119
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:08,200
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

120
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,520
Negative 1.5.

121
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,520
Negative 1, negative 1.5.

122
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,100
Yep, looks pretty good.

123
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,020
It looks like it's equidistant
from this point and

124
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,550
that point up there.

125
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,090
Now that's all you
have to remember.

126
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:21,485
Average the x, or take the mean
of the x, or find the x

127
00:05:21,485 --> 00:05:22,840
that's right in between
the two.

128
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,800
Average the y's.

129
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,050
You've got the midpoint.

130
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:28,160
What I'm going to show you now
is what's in many textbooks.

131
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,530
They'll write, oh, if I have
the point x1 y1, and then I

132
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:36,250
have the point-- actually, I'll
just stick it in yellow.

133
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,950
It's kind of painful to switch
colors all the time-- and then

134
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:43,390
I have the point x2 y2, many
books will give you something

135
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,900
called the midpoint formula.

136
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,820
Which once again, I think is
kind of silly to memorize.

137
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,460
Just remember, you
just average.

138
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,780
Find the x in between, find
the y in between.

139
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,675
So midpoint formula.

140
00:05:53,675 --> 00:05:57,080
   

141
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,880
What they'll really say is the
midpoint-- so maybe we'll say

142
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:04,410
the midpoint x-- or maybe
I'll call it this way.

143
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,560
I'm just making up notation.

144
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,080
The x midpoint and the y
midpoint is going to be equal

145
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:16,170
to-- and they'll give you this
formula. x1 plus x2 over 2,

146
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:19,580
and then y1 plus y2 over 2.

147
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,070
And it looks like something
you have to memorize.

148
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,140
But all you have to
say is, look.

149
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:27,090
That's just the average,
or the mean,

150
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:28,340
of these two numbers.

151
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:32,040
   

152
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,050
I'm adding the two together,
dividing by two, adding these

153
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,730
two together, dividing by two.

154
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,900
And then I get the midpoint.

155
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,770
That's all the midpoint
