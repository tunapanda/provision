1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,400
   

2
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,670
Let's talk a little bit about
the structure of the cell.

3
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:06,480
I've done a lot of videos where
we deal with things that

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,560
go on inside of them, but I
haven't done one where we just

5
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,870
talk about the entire
structure of them.

6
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:14,500
So a good place to start is--
let me just draw the membrane.

7
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,850
And the cellular membrane is a
good place to start because

8
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,780
this is what separates the cell
from the outside world,

9
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:24,020
and to a large degree, it kind
of defines the cell.

10
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:27,200
It defines it as this very,
very small compartment.

11
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,220
That's where the word,
"cell" came from.

12
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,870
So let me label that.

13
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:35,390
Cellular membrane.

14
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:39,570
And all cells have a
cellular membrane.

15
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:45,490
Now if we think about maybe the
most important thing that

16
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:48,590
defines a cell, you've probably
seen in the DNA

17
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,680
videos and we're going to talk
about translation and

18
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,300
transcription and all of that,
that what defines what a

19
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,440
living organism is,
is its DNA.

20
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,570
So all cells have DNA
inside of it.

21
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,270
And I won't go into the details
of how DNA defines

22
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,150
what an organism is.

23
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:03,580
I've done that in some detail
on the DNA videos.

24
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,019
But all cells have DNA.

25
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:09,150
This is more of an anatomy of a
cell video than necessarily

26
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,200
the function, but we'll go into
the function because we

27
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,780
need to know what these
different parts do.

28
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,610
So this is, right here,
this is the DNA.

29
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,390
And it's in its chromatin
form here.

30
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:21,190
There's also little
proteins here.

31
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:23,170
Not in all organisms, but
we're going to stick to

32
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:25,000
eukaryotes, and I'll talk
a little bit about the

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,635
difference between eukaryotes
and prokaryotes in a second.

34
00:01:28,635 --> 00:01:29,940
But we have DNA.

35
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,390
As I've drawn this cell right
now, this is pretty much any

36
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,810
cell, and any animal or plant
or whatever kingdom

37
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:38,840
could look like this.

38
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,300
I haven't drawn a lot
of the details.

39
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,270
I've just drawn the DNA and
the cellular membrane.

40
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:47,460
Now here's kind of the first
major division in the living

41
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:52,430
world, or at least from our
point of view, or it seemed

42
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,560
obvious, is that some
cells have a

43
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,330
membrane around the DNA.

44
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:01,970
So they'll have a membrane
around the DNA that separates

45
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:05,100
the DNA and the chromatin and
everything that makes up the

46
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,090
stuff within the DNA, separates
that from the rest

47
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:11,130
of the cell, and this
is called a nucleus.

48
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:14,920
This is called a nucleus.

49
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,670
And I said that's a major
division because when some

50
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,770
people looked at some cells
and they saw a nucleus and

51
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,780
other cells and they didn't see
a nucleus, they said, hey,

52
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,210
this is a good way to classify
organisms. So they called the

53
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:27,480
things that had nucleuses,
eukaryotes.

54
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,470
   

55
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,150
These have a nucleus.

56
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:36,950
So as I've drawn this cell right
here, it is a eukaryote.

57
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:40,350
Now, if you do not have a
nucleus, you are dealing with

58
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,600
a prokaryote.

59
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,180
   

60
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:48,440
No nucleus.

61
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,320
And examples of prokaryotes,
the two big groups of them,

62
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:57,110
are bacteria and Archaea.

63
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,200
Now, Archaea are really
interesting.

64
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,900
We know very little
about them.

65
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,190
They were originally thought to
be types of bacteria, but

66
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,770
now people are realizing that
they're this whole completely

67
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:10,870
other group, and we've actually
observed a very small

68
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,050
subset of them, so it's a
very fascinating group.

69
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:16,040
And it actually turns out that,
evolutionarily speaking,

70
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,300
you shouldn't make this division
first. It actually

71
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,800
makes more sense to divide
things into eukaryotes, I'll

72
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:27,100
just write that Euk, bacteria
and Archaea.

73
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,230
You don't want to do this
division first. There are

74
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:31,370
actually three separate
groups that you want

75
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,790
to start off with.

76
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,840
We'll talk more about this
in future videos.

77
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,280
But if you want to say
who has a nucleus?

78
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,110
Well, eukaryotes have a
nucleus by definition.

79
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,670
Who does not have a nucleus?

80
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:46,110
Well, the bacteria and the
Archaea do not have nuclei,

81
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:46,740
just like that.

82
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:49,780
But I'm going to focus on
eukaryotes because they tend

83
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,500
to be a little bit
more complex.

84
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,070
They tend to be larger.

85
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:55,720
And most of what we talk about,
at least in the videos

86
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,810
so far, are dealing
with eukaryotes.

87
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:02,840
Eukaryotes include plants,
animals-- we're animals, at

88
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:08,680
least I am-- animals and fungi,
and there are other

89
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,020
groups within eukaryotes, but
these are the ones that we

90
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,290
normally deal with in
our everyday world.

91
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:16,829
But let's go back to looking
at the anatomy of the cell.

92
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:18,000
So we have our DNA.

93
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,839
We know that it gets transcribed
into mRNA, That

94
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:29,540
mRNA leaves the nucleus, and
it gets translated into

95
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,390
proteins at the ribosomes.

96
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:36,530
So the ribosomes are these
little complexes that could be

97
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:38,780
floating all over the cell, and
we'll see in a second that

98
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,430
they can also be attached
to these other membrane

99
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,280
structures.

100
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,530
So this is a ribosome.

101
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:47,560
   

102
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,590
And if all this talk of DNA
transcription into mRNA and

103
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:55,000
mRNA leaving the nucleus and
traveling to the ribosome to

104
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,710
be translated into proteins
makes no sense to you, there

105
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,720
are several videos where I
go into that in detail.

106
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,660
But what I want to do is just
focus on all of the different

107
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,820
parts to kind of give a
big picture of things.

108
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:11,590
So ribosomes are where mRNA that
gets transcribed inside

109
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:18,750
the nucleus from DNA, where it
gets translated into proteins.

110
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,580
So you can kind of view them as
the place where information

111
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,720
actually turns into proteins,
which then can be used

112
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,500
anywhere else in the cell.

113
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,160
And these ribosomes, they're
made up of proteins, and

114
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,300
actually they're made up of RNA.

115
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,000
And so one question is, well,
where are the pieces of the

116
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,080
ribosomes made?

117
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,190
Well, some are made by proteins,
which might be made

118
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,600
in other ribosomes.

119
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,360
But some of it, the mRNA,
ribosomes, you can kind of

120
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,770
view them as this big
mess, if you were to

121
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:47,980
look at it in detail.

122
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,900
There's some protein there.

123
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,720
And I'm not drawing it that
realistically, but then you

124
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,130
have some mRNA tied in with
the protein, and the mRNA

125
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:58,490
isn't used for actual
information purposes like it

126
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:01,060
normally is when it goes from
DNA to the ribosome.

127
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:05,770
Within the ribosome itself,
ribosomal RNA is actually used

128
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:06,890
as part of the structure.

129
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:10,480
It actually helps the ribosome
function as a ribosome.

130
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,420
So it's actually part
of the ribosome.

131
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:20,060
And all of that gets built in
a part of the nucleus called

132
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,960
the nucleolus or the nucleole.

133
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,070
Let me write that down.

134
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,970
So this right here, this is
interesting right here.

135
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:34,680
This is the nucleolus
or the nucleole.

136
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,860
And it isn't a separate
organelle, and it's not

137
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,550
separated by a membrane, but it
shows up in a microscope.

138
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,130
So when people first saw it,
they said, hey, there's like a

139
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:41,980
bundle there.

140
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:45,210
That must be like the core of
the nucleus or something.

141
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:47,920
But it turns out what it is,
it's the densely packed--

142
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,190
you've got DNA and RNA, and
that's actually where the

143
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:54,240
ribosomal RNA, the stuff that
makes up the ribosomes, is

144
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,020
actually produced.

145
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,820
But it's so dense that it shows
up on a microscope, and

146
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,080
that's why people decided to
name it something different.

147
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,510
But it is not membrane bound.

148
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,960
It's not an organelle
within an organelle.

149
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,090
It's just densely packed
proteins and ribosomal RNA,

150
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:11,550
and it's where ribosomal
RNA gets produced.

151
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,620
So anyway, we're at
the ribosome.

152
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,400
That's where proteins
get produced.

153
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,030
But if the ribosomes are just
floating around, if they're

154
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:21,340
free ribosomes, then those
proteins will just-- once

155
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,430
they're produced at the
ribosome, they'll just float

156
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,590
around here in the fluid
inside the cell

157
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:26,840
that we call cytosol.

158
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,190
   

159
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:32,830
But what if we wanted to produce
proteins that are

160
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:36,950
supposed to end up, maybe in the
membrane of the cell, or

161
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:39,850
maybe outside of the
cell itself?

162
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,970
Cells produce things that are
used by other cells, that are

163
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:43,450
used by the rest of the body.

164
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:47,440
And here we have to go to
proteins that are attached to

165
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,220
this membrane.

166
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,580
You can kind of view it
as a bunch of tunnels.

167
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,880
Let me see how well
I can draw that.

168
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,130
I'm going to draw
it very roughly.

169
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:58,670
You have this thing called the
endoplasmic reticulum.

170
00:07:58,670 --> 00:07:59,920
Endoplasmic reticulum.

171
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,990
   

172
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:06,210
You can just view it as a bunch
of tunnels like that.

173
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,460
Endoplasmic reticulum.

174
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,470
   

175
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:13,140
And they eventually lead to
something called Golgi bodies,

176
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,730
named after Mr. Golgi himself.

177
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:18,110
So I'll do the endoplasmic
reticulum in yellow and I'll

178
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:23,520
do the Golgi bodies in green
maybe, just like that.

179
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,340
I'll tell you in a second
what they are.

180
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,170
So what's going on?

181
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:30,200
This is kind of a big kind of
stack, or you can kind of view

182
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,250
it as a bunch of folded
membranes together.

183
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:36,039
And some ribosomes are actually
attached to this

184
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:38,840
part, which I call the
endoplasmic reticulum.

185
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,880
So we have ribosomes attached.

186
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,400
Some of them are free, some
of them are attached.

187
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,060
And let me write
my labels down.

188
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:51,540
So this right here, and we use
the space over here, this big

189
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:55,430
flap of convoluted
membrane, that's

190
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:56,680
the endoplasmic reticulum.

191
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:02,206
   

192
00:09:02,206 --> 00:09:04,020
It's fun to say.

193
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,660
Endoplasmic reticulum.

194
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:08,510
Maybe a good name for a band.

195
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:11,780
Endoplasmic reticulum, and the
parts that have ribosomes

196
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:14,860
attached to it are called the
rough endoplasmic reticulum.

197
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,140
Maybe even a better
name for a band.

198
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:21,750
So right here, where I have
attached ribosomes, so these

199
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,770
ribosomes are attached right
here, this is the rough

200
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:28,640
endoplasmic reticulum, or
maybe the rough ER.

201
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:35,410
The rough ER, ER standing for
endoplasmic reticulum.

202
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:38,210
And then where we don't have any
ribosomes attached, that's

203
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:41,530
the smooth endoplasmic
reticulum.

204
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:48,070
So right here, that is this
smooth endoplasmic reticulum.

205
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:50,340
And I'm going to tell you in a
second what this is, but we

206
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,870
can keep following
the membranes.

207
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,490
Eventually we get the
Golgi bodies.

208
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:57,650
   

209
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:59,500
And what happens is,
I gave you a hint.

210
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,430
In our free ribosomes, mRNA gets
there, gets translated

211
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,610
into proteins, and the proteins
then just float

212
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:06,360
around in the cytosol.

213
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,930
But what if we want proteins
that should end up in

214
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:11,190
membranes or that end up
outside of the cell?

215
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:14,000
And that's where the endoplasmic
reticulum and the

216
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,890
Golgi bodies come into play.

217
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:20,680
Because now what we can do is,
we have mRNA coming outside of

218
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:24,560
the nucleus, and it can attach
to the ribosomes or it can be

219
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,690
translated by the ribosomes
in the rough ER.

220
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:30,190
And what happens here is your
mRNA comes here and it's

221
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:32,240
getting-- and I drew that
arrow very small-- it's

222
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,725
getting translated on the
outside of the endoplasmic

223
00:10:34,725 --> 00:10:38,940
reticulum, but as the protein
gets produced, it's getting

224
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:42,660
pushed into the inside of the
endoplasmic reticulum.

225
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,950
And when I say the inside of the
endoplasmic reticulum, I'm

226
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,590
talking about this area.

227
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:47,470
I'm coloring it in.

228
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:51,030
This is the inside of the
endoplasmic reticulum.

229
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:53,070
And so the proteins will
get pushed into

230
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,440
the endoplasmic reticulum.

231
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,400
The ones that are to be used
outside of the cytosol,

232
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,400
outside of the cell or maybe
in the cell's membrane.

233
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,350
So proteins will end up here.

234
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:04,120
That's why those ribosomes are
on the membrane, because they

235
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,315
can translate things that are
outside of the endoplasmic

236
00:11:06,315 --> 00:11:11,800
reticulum, but as the proteins
get produced, the amino acid

237
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,430
chain ends up inside of it.

238
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:16,630
Let me make a blow-up
of that because I

239
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,930
think that'll be useful.

240
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:23,430
So let me draw-- let's say this
is the membrane of the

241
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:26,450
endoplasmic reticulum
and then you have

242
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:29,080
ribosomes attached to it.

243
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,900
Let's say that's a ribosome on
the endoplasmic reticulum.

244
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,860
And is this is going to be the
rough endoplasmic reticulum.

245
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,790
And what you can have is mRNA
coming into one side of it.

246
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:43,820
   

247
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,860
mRNA can kind of come
in through here.

248
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,050
Maybe it's going in
that direction.

249
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:51,430
It's getting translated
into the proteins.

250
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:54,810
But then the protein, as the
amino acid chain is built up,

251
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:57,710
will pop out on this end
of the membrane.

252
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:00,300
Remember, this is our membrane
of our endoplasmic reticulum.

253
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,070
So even though the mRNA is on
the outside, because the

254
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:05,710
ribosome is attached to
it, the protein can

255
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:06,790
show up on the inside.

256
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:09,510
So once the protein is built,
maybe then it folds all up,

257
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:13,900
you know, a protein is just a
folded chain of amino acids,

258
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,375
it can travel through the
endoplasmic reticulum.

259
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:17,920
And it travels through it.

260
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,140
It travels through the smooth
endoplasmic reticulum all the

261
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,590
way until it gets to
the Golgi bodies.

262
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:23,870
And all sorts of other
things happen.

263
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:26,223
I'm oversimplifying things, but
I just want to give you a

264
00:12:26,223 --> 00:12:28,580
sense of what everything
in the cell does.

265
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:31,390
And once the protein travels to
the Golgi bodies and they

266
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:35,230
get ready for traveling outside
of the cell, or maybe

267
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:38,710
traveling to the cell's
membrane, they'll actually bud

268
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:39,770
out of the Golgi bodies.

269
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:42,530
So let's say this same protein,
when it gets to the

270
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:45,225
Golgi bodies-- remember it's
inside of the Golgi body, so

271
00:12:45,225 --> 00:12:48,800
let me draw the membrane of the
Golgi body right there.

272
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,520
The protein might
end up there.

273
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,830
It's just a big chain
of amino acids.

274
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,880
And then it will bud out.

275
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,780
So let's say it looks like that,
and then maybe the next

276
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:59,630
step it will look
something like.

277
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:00,880
It will look like that.

278
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:07,180
   

279
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,310
And the very next step, you
could imagine, will look

280
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:11,870
something like this, where
it's actually completely

281
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:12,420
budded out.

282
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:15,850
It's popped out a little
of the membrane of the

283
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:18,070
Golgi body with it.

284
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:20,010
So now the protein
is surrounded by

285
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:22,760
its own little membrane.

286
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,590
So let's think about
what happened.

287
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:27,260
We had DNA transcribed
into mRNA.

288
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:30,980
mRNA goes to a ribosome
that's attached to

289
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,740
the endoplasmic reticulum.

290
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,740
It is translated into a protein
that travels through

291
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,320
the endoplasmic reticulum.

292
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,150
First, the rough, where
all the ribosomes

293
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,410
are, then this smooth.

294
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:41,740
The smooth has other
functions.

295
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:48,520
It also helps produce hormones
and other fatty compounds, but

296
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,850
I won't go into detail there.

297
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:50,940
But it just travels.

298
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,070
It connects to the
Golgi bodies.

299
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:56,480
Then the Golgi bodies, the
proteins can bud off and take

300
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,340
a little bit of the
membrane with it.

301
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,900
And this idea of something being
surrounded by a membrane

302
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,400
and just traveling in the cell,
so maybe the protein now

303
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,100
looks like this.

304
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:06,930
I'm enlarging it.

305
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,380
Maybe the protein is there and
then it took a little bit of

306
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:12,200
the Golgi body membrane
with it.

307
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,780
This is called a vesicle.

308
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:17,750
And this right here, let's add
another one right here.

309
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,980
I'm just doing that
to label it.

310
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:23,160
That's called a vesicle.

311
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,110
And a vesicle is really just
a very general term for

312
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:30,280
anything, little small things,
mostly proteins, in the cell

313
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,430
that are just floating around,
that are surrounded by their

314
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:34,320
own little mini-membranes.

315
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,780
And the reason why this
mini-membrane is useful is now

316
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:39,430
this protein can now
float to the outer

317
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:40,430
membrane of the cell.

318
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:42,130
It can also float to other
parts of the cell.

319
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:43,780
I'm doing a simplification.

320
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:47,010
And then it can merge either
with the membrane of the cell,

321
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:50,950
or it can use this membrane,
this little vesicle membrane

322
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:54,240
it has, to facilitate it getting
out of the cell.

323
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,810
You can imagine that it
eventually, you know this

324
00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:00,430
thing-- let's say this is the
outer membrane of the cell.

325
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:02,470
And I'm doing a gross
oversimplification.

326
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,230
I'm not even drawing
the bilipid layer.

327
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:07,580
But just to have a visual
impression of what it might

328
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:11,880
look like, that's the vesicle
there, the little protein

329
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,680
inside of it, and it gets
closer and closer to the

330
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,530
membrane, and then it can
merge with the membrane

331
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:20,300
because it's made up
of the same stuff.

332
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:24,060
It merges with the membrane,
your protein inside.

333
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,250
I switched colors arbitrarily.

334
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,140
But now, all of a sudden, once
it merges with the membrane,

335
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:31,920
then the protein can exit the
actual cell, or maybe it can

336
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,210
actually embed itself within
this membrane, within the

337
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:39,200
outer cellular membrane, which
I drew very thin, but it has

338
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:39,960
two layers to it.

339
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,970
And we'll talk more
about that.

340
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:44,130
And I could probably make
a whole video on it.

341
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:47,970
So those are-- we've already
made pretty good progress on

342
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:49,400
showing the anatomy
of the cell.

343
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,360
There are a few other things
we can throw in there.

344
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:58,860
There are things called
lysosomes, which exist in

345
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:03,840
animal cells that contain
enzymes in them that help

346
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,155
dissolve other things.

347
00:16:05,155 --> 00:16:08,720
   

348
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,050
So if a lysosome attaches to
something else and is able to

349
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:14,950
spew its enzymes into it,
it usually kills it.

350
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,140
It usually digests it.

351
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,100
So that's what a
lysosome does.

352
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:23,310
In plants, you have things
called lytic vacuoles, and

353
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:25,600
those are really the same thing
as a lysosome in terms

354
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,280
of their function in that
they're really big vesicles.

355
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,590
In fact, in general, a vacuole
is just a big vesicle.

356
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:36,630
It's just a general term for a
big membrane-bound organelle.

357
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,430
Vacuole.

358
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,280
And once again, what's
an organelle?

359
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,000
Let me write down that word.

360
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,730
Organelle.

361
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:48,780
It's just a membrane-bound
subunit of a cell.

362
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:51,430
Just like my liver is a subunit
of Sal and it's an

363
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:55,480
organ, an organelle is
a subunit of a cell.

364
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:59,020
So a vacuole is just a general
term for a membrane-bound

365
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:02,290
organelle that stores stuff
inside of our cells.

366
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:05,079
   

367
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:08,400
So a lytic vacuole would be a
vacuole in a plant cell that

368
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,440
stores a bunch of enzymes, and
if it were attached to

369
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,619
something else it would dissolve
it if it were able to

370
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:16,069
spew its enzymes into
the other thing.

371
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:19,050
Now, there's several organelles
that we've talked

372
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:21,230
about within the context
of respiration and

373
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:24,619
photosynthesis, and I go into
detail in those videos.

374
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:28,390
But we have things called
mitochondria.

375
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,070
Mitochondrion cells.

376
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:33,610
And they have inner and outer
membranes, and this is where

377
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:38,470
we produce our energy, where
sugars are turned into ATP.

378
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:40,270
I've done detailed
videos on this.

379
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:43,350
These actually contain their own
DNA, and they can actually

380
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:50,070
reproduce on their own, which
makes people believe that they

381
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:54,780
exist-- that their ancestors
once existed as independent

382
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:59,910
prokaryotic organisms, that at
some point they just kind of

383
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:03,715
stumbled upon the notion of,
hey, why don't I live inside

384
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:06,650
of other organisms and kind
of live in symbiosis?

385
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:11,020
So mitochondria, these are
organelles that at one time

386
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:13,140
their ancestors might have been
independent prokaryotes.

387
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:17,390
   

388
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:19,400
Mitochondria.

389
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,810
That's where cellular
respiration takes part, and we

390
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:23,750
go into detail on that.

391
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,640
And then on the plant cells,
this is only in-- well,

392
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,830
definitely not in animal cells--
you have chloroplasts,

393
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,900
which are a subset of things
called plastids, but

394
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,990
chloroplasts are the
most famous.

395
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:37,130
Maybe I should do that in
especially green, green.

396
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:38,320
So we have chloroplasts.

397
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,980
And we know they have little
thylakoids in there.

398
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,750
This is where photosynthesis
takes place.

399
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,270
You have your grana
and all of that.

400
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:45,840
And I do go into detail in the
photosynthesis videos, but

401
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,280
it's good to know.

402
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,680
These are other organelles.

403
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,950
And just like mitochondria, they
have their own DNA and

404
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,440
their own ribosomes.

405
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,780
And so the belief is that they
were once independent

406
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:01,210
prokaryotes that learned to live
in symbiosis inside of

407
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:04,090
larger eukaryotic cells.

408
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:06,360
So we're almost done, really,
with the structure cells.

409
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,620
There's other things we
can throw on here.

410
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:12,800
If we're dealing with plant
cells or non-animal cells,

411
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,080
we'll have something called a
cell wall, which will give

412
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,380
some strength to the
outer membrane.

413
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,090
You can kind of view
it that way, or it

414
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:21,680
gives it some rigidity.

415
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,480
So you have things called cell
walls, although they're not

416
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,430
necessarily completely rigid.

417
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,460
You can almost view them as
balloons that provide just a

418
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,330
little bit more rigidity.

419
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:32,530
Things like wood actually have
double cell walls for really

420
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:33,400
hard-core rigidity.

421
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,160
So this is a cell wall.

422
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,170
This is in non-animals.

423
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:43,810
And in plants it's made out of
cellulose, not cellulite.

424
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:44,710
That used to confuse me.

425
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:47,840
So this gives extra rigidity
or form to

426
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,510
the cellular membrane.

427
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:53,710
And then to actually give the
cell its actual structure, you

428
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:56,450
have these things called
microfilaments, or sometimes

429
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:58,890
actin filaments, and these are
these little pipes that go

430
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:00,170
throughout the cell.

431
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:03,810
These actually help give the
cell its actual structure in

432
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:05,880
three dimensions, and actually,
they can participate

433
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,150
in things moving around within
the cell or even the cell

434
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,910
moving around itself.

435
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,780
And just to be complete and
make sure we're covering

436
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:15,620
everything, if you watch the
mitosis and meiosis videos,

437
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:18,800
you have these things
called centrioles.

438
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,940
I go into detail there.

439
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:24,660
Centrioles that are right
outside of the nucleus.

440
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:28,150
Two centrioles that are at right
angles to each other

441
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:32,080
make up a centrosome, and they
kind of coordinate the

442
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,870
microtubules when we start
splitting the cells in mitosis

443
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:37,760
and meiosis.

444
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,710
I won't go into detail there.

445
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:40,490
I've done many videos
on that as well.

446
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:42,930
But so far, this is pretty much
everything you need to

447
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:46,860
know-- or at least a first
overview-- of the

448
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,070
structure of the cell.

449
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:50,960
And in one video, we finally
got it all in one place.

450
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,060
This is pretty much-- I haven't
delved into detail on

451
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:57,170
everything-- on all of the
major pieces of the cell.

452
00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:00,820
So hopefully, you have a better
big-picture view of how

453
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,560
things are organized
inside of it.
