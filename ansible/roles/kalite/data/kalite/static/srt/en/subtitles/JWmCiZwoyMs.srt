1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,930
   

2
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:05,400
Write 15:25 as a fraction
in simplest form.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,350
So 15 to 25 is just a ratio,
and we can write it.

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:14,280
So they've given us 15 to 25.

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:20,600
And you can write this ratio as
a fraction, as 15 over 25.

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,270
And if we want to put this in
simplest form, we just have to

7
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:26,390
think about what is the largest
number that divides

8
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:28,830
into both 15 and 25?

9
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,810
Or what is their greatest
common factor?

10
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,470
When you just eyeball it, you
say, well, 5 goes into both of

11
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:36,120
them, and I'm pretty sure that's
the largest number that

12
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,940
divides into both, so let's
divide both by 5.

13
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,430
If there is a larger number,
then we might be able to see

14
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,240
it once we've simplified
it a little bit more.

15
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,820
So let's divide the numerator
and the denominator by 5 and

16
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,260
see what we get.

17
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:52,560
So now we get 15 divided
by 5 is equal to 3.

18
00:00:52,560 --> 00:01:00,470
And 25 divided by 5 is equal
to 5, and now we have 3/5.

19
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:04,910
3 and 5 don't share any common
factors greater than 1, so it

20
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:06,750
is in simplest form.

21
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,580
So we've done what they asked.

22
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,830
We've written it as a fraction
in simplest form.

23
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,090
We could also write this, if
we want to write it in this

24
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:15,625
type of notation, as 3:5.

25
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:18,667
