1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,590
   

2
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:04,300
Let's do some example problems
dealing with functions and

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,990
their domains and ranges.

4
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:10,330
Just as a review, a function
is just an operator-- let's

5
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,860
say this function is f; that
tends to be the most typical

6
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:16,309
letter for functions-- that
operates on some input, in

7
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:21,140
this case, the input is x, and
it produces some output y.

8
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,950
Or you could view it as you take
some input x, put it into

9
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:28,740
your function box f, and it's
going to operate on it and

10
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,980
produce some y.

11
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:36,390
And the set of values that x
can take on is the domain.

12
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,320
The set of values that f can
legitimately operate on,

13
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,390
that's the domain.

14
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:43,110
And the set of values
y that f can

15
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,140
produce, that is the range.

16
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,080
Now, with that in mind, let's
figure out, one, the function

17
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,440
definitions for each of these
problems here, these example

18
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,250
problems, and then figure out
the domains and the ranges.

19
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:02,140
So here we have Dustin charges
$10.00 per hour-- so let me

20
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,870
write that down-- $10.00 per
hour for mowing lawns.

21
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:08,900
So how much does he charge
as a function of hours?

22
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,020
So let's say Dustin charges, so
the function, I'll call it

23
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,670
d for Dustin.

24
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:16,460
Dustin charges as a
function of hours.

25
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:17,385
It depends on hours.

26
00:01:17,385 --> 00:01:20,440
The input into our box
is going to be

27
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,950
hours that he worked.

28
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:26,290
It's going to be equal to the
number of hours times 10.

29
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:31,020
It's going to be 10 times-- I
won't write the times there.

30
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,640
Maybe I can just write 10h.

31
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,490
And, of course, he can't work
negative hours, so we could

32
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:41,210
write h is going to be greater
than or equal to 0.

33
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:42,890
That's our function
definition.

34
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:45,740
If you say, hey, how much is he
going to charge for working

35
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,750
half an hour?

36
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:51,160
You put 1/2 in here, which
essentially substitutes this h

37
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,120
with a 1/2.

38
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,240
You do 10 times 1/2.

39
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,970
Let me write that down
on the side here.

40
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:58,780
So Dustin's going to charge
for 1/2 hour.

41
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,470
He's going to charge 10--
wherever you see the h,

42
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:07,050
replace it with 1/2-- times 1/2,
which is equal to $5.00.

43
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,210
That's our function
definition.

44
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:11,660
I was just showing you an
example of applying it.

45
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:14,023
Now, let's figure out the
domain and the range.

46
00:02:14,023 --> 00:02:17,980
   

47
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,480
So I almost explicitly say
it here, you can't

48
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,500
work negative hours.

49
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,900
This number, this function,
is not defined if h

50
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,380
is less than 0.

51
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,630
So we could say non-negative.

52
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:33,790
   

53
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:38,580
And we could say real numbers,
which it could be everything

54
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,700
including pi and e
and all of that.

55
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,320
But you can't legitimately
charge

56
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,760
someone 10 times pi dollars.

57
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,760
That's not a legitimate amount
that one can charge someone in

58
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,440
the real world, because at the
end of the day, you have to

59
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,050
round to the penny.

60
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,370
You can't actually
charge them that.

61
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,040
So any number that he
charges is going to

62
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,010
be a rational number.

63
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:59,880
It can be expressed
as a fraction.

64
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,680
So we can kind of take out
numbers like e and pi.

65
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,440
So if we want to be really cute
about it, we would say

66
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,860
non-negative.

67
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:11,210
rational numbers.

68
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:14,160
And these are just numbers that
can be expressed as a

69
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,010
fraction, which are most
numbers, just not these

70
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:23,040
numbers that just keep not
repeating and all of that.

71
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,700
So non-negative rational
numbers is what he

72
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,890
can input in here.

73
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:36,060
And then the range, which is
the valid-- once again,

74
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,750
whatever number you put in for
h, remember, you can only put

75
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:42,350
in non-negative values for h,
non-negative rational values

76
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:46,310
for h, so whatever numbers you
put in for h, you're going to

77
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:50,530
get positive values for how much
he charges for 10h, for

78
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:51,880
the value of the function.

79
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:58,090
So once again it's going to be
non-negative, and if you put a

80
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,700
rational number here and it's
being expressed as a fraction

81
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,130
and you multiply it by 10,
it's still going to be a

82
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:03,380
rational number.

83
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:08,030
   

84
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,840
And if you want to be really
cute, you could say any number

85
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,860
that could be expressed
as a dollar sign.

86
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,730
But anyway, I don't want to get
too cute on this problem.

87
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:14,960
I think you get the idea.

88
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,660
Let's do more

89
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,649
problems. All right.

90
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:21,100
Here we have Maria doing
some tutoring.

91
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:25,410
Maria charges $25.00 per hour
for tutoring math with a

92
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,740
minimum charge of $15.00.

93
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:32,010
So Maria charges as a
function of hours.

94
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:36,710
So she's going to charge
$15.00 if you don't get

95
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:37,650
enough hours in.

96
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:41,510
So at $25.00 per hour, in order
to make $15.00, you've

97
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:45,980
got to work 15/25, so
it's 3/5 of an hour.

98
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:53,100
So if her hours are less than
3/5 and greater than or equal

99
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,270
to 0, she's going to
charge $15.00.

100
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:00,490
Because if she only worked 1/5
of an hour, the bill would

101
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,150
have been $5.00, but
she says she has a

102
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:04,120
minimum charge of $15.00.

103
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,390
So she's going to charge $15.00
up until 3/5 of an

104
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,110
hour, or 36 minutes.

105
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:15,365
And then after that, for h
greater than 3/5, she's going

106
00:05:15,365 --> 00:05:17,400
to charge $25.00 an hour.

107
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,310
She's going to charge
25 times h.

108
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:24,990
So that's her function
definition right there.

109
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:28,890
Now, what is the domain,
the domain for

110
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:32,050
Maria's billing function?

111
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,940
Well, once again, this
is only defined for

112
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,190
non-negative numbers.

113
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:40,470
   

114
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:43,030
And by the same logic we used
here, we got a little cute.

115
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:47,860
We said, oh, she really can't
charge e hours or pi hours.

116
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,590
That's not realistic
for her to measure.

117
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:51,900
Everything's going to be
expressible as a fraction.

118
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,930
For example, even 5,
if you say 5 hours,

119
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:54,820
that's still a fraction.

120
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,790
That's 5 over 1.

121
00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:01,840
So let's say non-negative
rational numbers.

122
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,260
And what's the range of her
charging function or her

123
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,010
billing function?

124
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:10,660
Well, it has to be
at least $15.00.

125
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:13,005
No matter what, she's going to
charge $15.00, so it's going

126
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:15,430
to be $15.00 or more.

127
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:22,920
So it's going to be rational
numbers greater

128
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:30,420
than or equal to $15.00.

129
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:33,200
There's no situation in which
she will charge $14.00.

130
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,230
There's no situation
in which she would

131
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,960
charge negative $1.00.

132
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,380
Everything's going to be greater
than or equal to 15.

133
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,950
So now we have these more
abstract function definitions,

134
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:45,260
so now can stick really
any number in it.

135
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:45,930
Well, we're not going
to deal with

136
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:48,010
complexes, any real number.

137
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,610
But let's see if they limit
it a little bit.

138
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:50,453
So we have f of x.

139
00:06:50,453 --> 00:06:56,400
Let me rewrite it. f of x is
equal to 15x minus 12.

140
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,870
So what's the domain here?

141
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:03,420
What's our domain?

142
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:06,016
Well, I can stick any real
number x in here and I'm just

143
00:07:06,016 --> 00:07:08,230
going to multiply it by 15
and then subtract 12.

144
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,280
I could put pi there.

145
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,780
I could put the square
of 2 there.

146
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,450
I could put e there.

147
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:13,900
I could do all sorts
of crazy things.

148
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,935
So I'm going to say
all real numbers.

149
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:21,080
   

150
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,880
Any real number I put in for
x, I'm going to get a

151
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,540
legitimate output.

152
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,705
And then what is my range?

153
00:07:26,705 --> 00:07:29,460
   

154
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:33,730
Well, once again, this can take
on any value out there.

155
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:35,410
I can get to any negative
value if I

156
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:36,990
make x negative enough.

157
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,970
I'm going to subtract 12 from
it, but I could get to any

158
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:39,660
negative value.

159
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,920
I could get to zero.

160
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,880
I could get to any
positive value.

161
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:49,096
So this is also going to
be all real numbers.

162
00:07:49,096 --> 00:07:51,840
   

163
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,900
Now we have this function.

164
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:56,560
It says f of x is equal to--
they forgot the equal sign--

165
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,970
2x squared plus 5.

166
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:03,660
So what is the domain?

167
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,020
What are all of the valid values
for x that I could

168
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:07,800
stick here?

169
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,700
Well, I could stick
anything here.

170
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,550
I could put e there.

171
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,030
2 times e squared plus 5.

172
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,810
I could put a square
root of 2 there.

173
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:14,220
I could put a negative
number there.

174
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,910
So I could really take
on any real number.

175
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:26,260
All real numbers, positive or
negative or otherwise, or even

176
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,420
non-rational.

177
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:30,590
And then what is
the range here?

178
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,260
And this is interesting.

179
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:35,520
Because no matter what number
I put here, this value right

180
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,559
here is going to be
greater than zero.

181
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,045
This is going to be, right
here, non-negative.

182
00:08:41,045 --> 00:08:44,110
   

183
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,490
Even if you put a really
negative number here, you're

184
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,040
going to square it, so it's
going to become a really

185
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,640
positive number when
you square it.

186
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,460
So this expression right here
is going to be non-negative.

187
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:55,890
So if you take a non-negative
number and you add it to 5,

188
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:58,120
you're always going to get
something greater than or

189
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,140
equal to 5.

190
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,250
Worst case, this is a zero,
and then you get a 5.

191
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,690
But if this is either slightly
less than zero or slightly

192
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:07,750
more than zero, you're going to
get values greater than 5.

193
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:16,740
So the range is all real
numbers greater

194
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,450
than or equal to 5.

195
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:21,980
Your f of x could never take
on the value zero.

196
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:25,080
There's no way to get zero.

197
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,330
Problem 5.

198
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:29,690
   

199
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:34,900
They have f of x is
equal to 1 over x.

200
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:38,550
So, once again, our domain.

201
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,550
Well, we could put any
value in for x.

202
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,960
Any real number will
work here.

203
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,480
We're just going to take
the inverse of it.

204
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:48,830
So this is going to be all
reals, all real numbers.

205
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:51,380
And then what is the range?

206
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,450
This is interesting as well.

207
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:58,640
Because no matter what I put
here, I can put anything here.

208
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,550
Oh, actually, let me be
very, very careful.

209
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:03,670
This is not defined for
x is equal to 0.

210
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:08,980
All real that are not
equal to zero.

211
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,970
If I put zero here, I'm
going to get 1/0.

212
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:13,260
It will be undefined.

213
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,020
Let me write that down.

214
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:18,690
I almost made a mistake.
f of 0 is undefined.

215
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:20,380
And that literally means
we don't know what

216
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,150
to do with the zero.

217
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:24,680
We have not defined a way
to operate on a zero.

218
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,400
So f of 0 is undefined.

219
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:31,020
So the domain is all reals
except for zero.

220
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,120
And now what's the range?

221
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,210
Well, once again, we can take on
any value here except zero.

222
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:38,465
We could try to approach zero.

223
00:10:38,465 --> 00:10:41,220
If x got really, really, really,
really, really large,

224
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,500
then this will approach zero.

225
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,890
If x got really, really
negative, it'll approach zero.

226
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:51,130
But in no circumstance will we
actually ever get to zero.

227
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:58,210
So once again, all reals that
are not equal to zero.

228
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:01,830
All real numbers except
for zero.

229
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:02,370
All right.

230
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,080
Problem 6.

231
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,300
What is the range of the
function y is equal to x

232
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:10,100
squared minus 5 when the
domain is-- so they're

233
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,300
defining the domain.

234
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,110
They're restricting it.

235
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:16,470
They're saying the domain is
just the numbers minus 2,

236
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:20,410
minus 1, 0, 1, and 2.

237
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:24,640
So this function definition
really should say f of x is

238
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:32,660
equal to x squared minus 5 for x
is equal to-- we could write

239
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:39,180
any member for x is a member
of the set minus 2,

240
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:43,070
minus 1, 0, 1, 2.

241
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,420
It's not defined for x being
anything else to that.

242
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,860
You don't know what
to do with it.

243
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,600
You can only apply it if
x is one of these.

244
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,590
So what's the range?

245
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:54,035
Well, the range is all of the
functions, all the values that

246
00:11:54,035 --> 00:11:56,200
f of x can take on.

247
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:03,960
So the range is going to be the
set of values that we get

248
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,900
when we put in all of
these different x's.

249
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,280
So let's try this first
one: negative 2.

250
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,040
Negative 2 squared minus 5.

251
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,830
That's 4 minus 5.

252
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,615
That's negative 1.

253
00:12:15,615 --> 00:12:17,220
Let's do negative 1.

254
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,910
Negative 1 squared minus 5.

255
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:22,000
That is 1 minus 5.

256
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,050
That is negative 4.

257
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:25,140
You have 0.

258
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,450
0 squared.

259
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:30,750
So f of 0, you have 0 squared
minus 5, that's negative 5.

260
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,560
And you have 1.

261
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,940
1 squared minus 5, that's
negative 4, so it's

262
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,180
already in our range.

263
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,630
Then you have 2.

264
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:41,110
2 squared minus 5, that's
negative 1,

265
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,020
already in our range.

266
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:46,190
So that's all of the values that
this function can take

267
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,670
on, given that we've
restricted it

268
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,380
to only these inputs.

269
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,200
